<p class="first">The worship of minor local deities is connected with
such low castes as Guravas, Bhopis, Mar&aacute;tha Kunbis, Dhangars,
W&aacute;ghes, Murlis, Mah&aacute;rs and M&aacute;ngs in the District
of Kolh&aacute;pur. It is believed by the Br&aacute;hmans that once an
image is consecrated and worshipped, it should be worshipped
uninterruptedly every day, and he who neglects to worship such an image
daily incurs the sin of <i>Brahma-hatya</i> or Br&aacute;hman-murder.
For this reason Br&aacute;hmans generally do not worship minor local
deities. In former times Br&aacute;hmans who worshipped these deities
were excommunicated by their caste-men. Such <i>Puj&aacute;ris</i> were
compelled to wear a folded <i>dhotur</i> or waist cloth, and were
forbidden to put on the <i>gandh</i> or sandal paste mark in straight
or cross lines. They were allowed to put on the <i>tila</i> or circular
mark of sandal paste. Another reason why Br&aacute;hmans are not the
<i>Puj&aacute;ris</i> or worshippers of such deities is that
Br&aacute;hmans cannot accept or partake of the <i>Naivedya</i>
offering of cooked food, fowls, etc., made to them. Lower class people
can partake of such offerings, and are therefore generally the
worshippers or ministrants of minor local deities.</p>
<p>At Palshet in the Ratn&aacute;giri District, there are two
<i>gr&aacute;mdevis</i>, viz., Jhol&aacute;i and Mh&aacute;rj&aacute;i,
and the <i>puj&aacute;ris</i> of these deities are respectively a Gurav
and a Mah&aacute;r.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e390src" href="#xd27e390"

<p>It is considered by the Hindus very meritorious and holy to worship
the Sun; and by Br&aacute;hmans the Sun is considered to be their chief
deity. The <i>G&aacute;yatri Mantra</i> of the Br&aacute;hmans is a
prayer to the Sun-god or the Savita Dev, and the Br&aacute;hmans offer
<i>arghya</i> or oblations of water to the Sun thrice a day. Those who
want health, wealth and prosperity propitiate the Sun-god by prayers
and ceremonies. The <i>Ratha Saptami</i> is considered to be the
principal day for special worship and festivities in honour of the
Sun-god. On this day, on a low wooden stool, is drawn, in red sandal
paste, a figure of the Sun in human shape seated in a chariot drawn by
seven horses, or by a horse with seven faces. This figure is then
placed in the sun-shine, and it is then worshipped by offering it
<i>arghya</i> or spoonfuls of water, red powder, red flowers mixed with
red sandal paste, camphor, incense and fruits. Some people kneel down
while offering the <i>arghyas</i> to the Sun. These <i>arghyas</i> are
either three or twelve in number. Some persons make a vow not to eat
anything unless they have worshipped the Sun and performed the twelve
<i>Namaskaras</i> by falling prostrate and bowing with folded hands
twelve times, and at each time repeating one of the twelve names of the
Sun.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e529src" href="#xd27e529" name=
"xd27e529src">13</a></p>
<p>In the Ratn&aacute;giri District some people worship the Sun on the
Sundays of the month of <i>Shr&aacute;van</i>. A ceremony held on the
<i>Rathasaptami</i> day, <i>i.e.</i>, the 7th day of the bright half of
<i>M&aacute;gh</i>, is deemed a special festival in honour of the
Sun-god. On that day people draw, on a small wooden stool, an image of
the Sun, seated in a chariot drawn by seven horses, and worship it with
great reverence. Milk is then boiled on a fire made of cow-dung cakes
in front of the household <i>Tulsi</i> plant. If the milk overflows to
the east, it is believed that there will be abundance of crops, but if
it flows to the west it is taken as a sign of the near approach of
famine.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e550src" href="#xd27e550" name=
"xd27e550src">14</a> The Sun-god is also worshipped on the following
occasions, <i>e.g.</i>, <i>Trikal</i>, <i>Gajacch&aacute;ya</i>,
<i>Ardhodaya</i>, <i>Mahodaya</i>, <i>Vyatip&aacute;t</i>,
<i>Makar-Sankr&aacute;nt</i>, <i>Kark-Sankr&aacute;nt</i> and the Solar
eclipse.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e581src" href="#xd27e581" name=
"xd27e581src">15</a> Though there are few temples dedicated to the Sun,
the village of Parule has the honour of having one called &ldquo;the
temple of Adi-N&aacute;r&aacute;yan.&rdquo; Non-Br&aacute;hmanical
classes are not seen worshipping the Sun in this district, despite the
fact that the Sun is said to be the embodiment of the three principal
deities of the Hindus.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e584src" href=
"#xd27e584" name="xd27e584src">16</a></p>
<p>The people of the Th&aacute;na District believe that the
<i>Swastika</i> is the central point of the helmet of the Sun, and a
vow called the <i>Swastika Vrata</i> is held in its honor. A woman who
observes this vow, draws a figure of the <i>Swastika</i> and worships
it daily during the <i><span class="corr" id="xd27e599" title=
"Source: Ch&aacute;turm&acirc;s">Ch&aacute;turm&aacute;s</span></i>
(four months of the rainy season), at the expiration of which she gives
a Br&aacute;hman a golden or silver plate with the sign of the Swastika
upon it.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e602src" href="#xd27e602" name=
"xd27e602src">17</a> Another vow named <i>Dhanurm&aacute;s</i>, common
to all districts in the Konkan, requires a person to complete his daily
rites before sun-rise, and to offer a <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb3" href="#pb3" name="pb3">3</a>]</span>preparation of food called
<i>Khichadi</i> to the Sun-god. The observer of this vow then partakes
of the food, regarding it as a gift from that god. This is either done
for one day or repeated for a month till the
<i>Dhanu-Sankr&aacute;nt</i>.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e617src" href=
"#xd27e617" name="xd27e617src">18</a> On the
<i>Somavati-Am&aacute;v&aacute;sya</i> day (the 15th day of the dark
half of a month falling on Monday), and the <i>Kapil&aacute;shasthi</i>
day, the Sun is held in especial reverence.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e627src" href="#xd27e627" name="xd27e627src">19</a> A curious
story is narrated regarding the offering of <i>Arghya</i> to the Sun.
It is said that the Sun rejoices at the birth of a Br&aacute;hman, and
gives 1,000,000 cows in charity, believing that the <i>Arghya</i> which
the Br&aacute;hman will offer later on will devour his foes, one drop
of the <i>Arghya</i> killing 1,000 of them<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e639src" href="#xd27e639" name="xd27e639src">20</a>. The
repetition of the <i>G&aacute;yatri-mantra</i> 108 times a day is
supposed to release a Br&aacute;hman from the debt of 1,000,000 cows
owed in this way to the Sun.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e646src" href=
"#xd27e646" name="xd27e646src">21</a> The <i>Yoga-Sutras</i> of
P&aacute;tanjali however prohibit a man from looking at the setting
Sun, though the sin thus incurred is made amends for by the offering of
<i>Arghya</i> to that god.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e655src" href=
"#xd27e655" name="xd27e655src">22</a> It is interesting to note that
women do not grind corn on the <i>Ratha-Saptami</i> day.<a class=

<p>Women bow down to the Sun on the 11th, 12th, 30th or 40th day after
their delivery; but Kunbi women generally worship that god on the 7th
day.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e673src" href="#xd27e673" name=
"xd27e673src">24</a> On this occasion some women show a churning

rice.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e682src" href="#xd27e682" name=

<p>The <i>Swastika</i> is considered so holy in the Konkan that it is
always drawn on the <i>Antarpat</i>; and at the time of the
<i>Puny&aacute;ha Wachan</i> ceremony which precedes a Hindu wedding, a
<i>Swastika</i> drawn in rice is worshipped.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e700src" href="#xd27e700" name="xd27e700src">27</a> The principal
deities of the Hindus, whenever they are invoked on special occasions,
are seated on the <i>Swastika</i>.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e707src"
href="#xd27e707" name="xd27e707src">28</a> The people of the
Ratn&aacute;giri District worship the <i>Swastika</i>, regarding it as

<p>By some the <i>Swastika</i> is regarded as the foundation-stone of
the universe<a class="noteref" id="xd27e721src" href="#xd27e721" name=

<p>The conception of Kunbi is said to have taken place by the influence
of the rays of the Sun.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e729src" href=
"#xd27e729" name="xd27e729src">32</a></p>
<p>The <i>Swastika</i> is considered as an emblem of peace and
prosperity, and for this reason Br&aacute;hman women draw a figure of
the <i>Swastika</i> in front of their houses.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e740src" href="#xd27e740" name="xd27e740src">33</a> The custom of
moving round such sacred objects as the Banyan, the <i>Pipal</i>, the
<i>Tulsi</i> or sweet basil plant, the <i>Umbar</i>, the <i>Avala</i>
(Phylanthus emblica), etc., is prevalent in the district of
Kolh&aacute;pur. There are no cases recorded in which women after
child-birth are exposed to the Sun. But on the 12th day after her
delivery, the mother puts on new bangles and new clothes; cocoanuts,
<span class="corr" id="xd27e761" title=
"Source: betel-nuts">betelnuts</span> and leaves, grains of rice,
plantains and grains of wheat are placed in her lap. She then comes out
and bows to the Sun. Wealthy persons on this occasion perform a
<i>homa</i> sacrifice in their houses by kindling the holy fire and
feeding Br&aacute;hmans. No one in this district believes that
conception is caused, or is likely to be caused, by exposure to the
rays of the Sun.</p>
<p>The Hindu women of the Konkan walk round <i>Pipal</i>, <i>Tulsi</i>,
and <i>Umbar</i> trees every Saturday and on the
<i>Somavati-am&aacute;v&aacute;sya</i> day, <i>i.e.</i>, the 15th day
of the dark half of a month when it falls on Monday.<a class="noteref"
id="xd27e785src" href="#xd27e785" name="xd27e785src">34</a> Sometimes,
however, women make a vow to walk round a <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb4" href="#pb4" name="pb4">4</a>]</span>temple or a sacred tree
one-hundred thousand times; and for the fulfilment of this vow they
walk round the temple or tree for about seven or eight hours every day.
If they find it difficult to make up the number of rounds themselves,
they ask their near relations to assist them in their
undertaking.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e790src" href="#xd27e790" name=

<p>The Moon is worshipped by the Hindus on the 2nd of the bright half
of every month. On this day it is considered very lucky to see the
moon, and many people, particularly the lower classes, pull out threads
from the clothes they wear, and offer them to the moon, saying
&ldquo;O! God, accept these old clothes of ours and be pleased to give
us new ones in their stead.&rdquo; Some people worship the moon on the
<i>Sankasti Chaturthi</i><span class="corr" title=
"Not in source">,</span> 4th day of the dark half of every month; and
such people will not eat anything until they have seen and worshipped
the moon on that day. The moon is not worshipped on the <i>Ganesh
Chaturthi</i> day that is, the 4th of the bright half of the month of
<i>Bh&aacute;drapad</i>, as it is considered very unlucky to see the
moon on that night. It is firmly believed that any one who sees the
moon on the <i>Ganesh Chaturthi</i> day even by accident will be
falsely accused of theft or some other crime. In order to avoid this,
people who have accidently seen the moon, throw stones at the houses of
their neighbours, and if the neighbours abuse them in return, the
mischief makers consider themselves freed by the abuse from the sin of
having looked at the moon on a forbidden night.</p>
<p>The spots on the surface of the moon are believed by some to be the
<i>rath</i> or chariot of the god. Others think that they are lunar
mountains; but many believe that the spots are the visible signs of the
stain on the character of the moon-god due to his having outraged the
modesty of the wife of his <i>guru</i>, the god Brahaspati or Jupiter.
In the <i>Pur&aacute;ns</i> it is stated that on one occasion, a
dispute arose between the moon and Brahaspati or Jupiter about the wife
of Brahaspati, each of them claiming to be the cause of her conception.
Subsequently a son was born who was named Budha (Mercury).
Brahaspati&rsquo;s wife, on being asked who was the father of the
child, named the moon. Thereupon Brahaspati cursed the moon for his
adultery. The spots on the surface of the moon are said to be the
effect of this curse.</p>
<p>The moon-god is believed to distribute nectar through his rays, and
therefore this deity is said to have the power of removing diseases and
restoring human beings to health. The moon is the king of herbs, and
all trees, plants, etc., thrive owing to the influence of the moon.
Sometimes people place at night, figs, plantains, sugarcane and other
eatables in the moon-light and eat them early in the morning; and it is
said that those who do so improve in health. The practice of drinking
the moon&rsquo;s rays does not prevail in the Kolh&aacute;pur district.
But people occasionally dine in the moon light.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e822src" href="#xd27e822" name="xd27e822src">36</a></p>
<p>On a full moon day people perform the special worship of their
chosen deity. On the full moon of the month of <i>K&aacute;rtika</i>
temples are illuminated, and on the full moon day of
<i>M&aacute;gha</i>, raw corn such as wheat, <i>b&aacute;jri</i>, etc.,
is cooked and offered to the household and other deities.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e841src" href="#xd27e841" name="xd27e841src">37</a>
On this day are also performed the special rites and ceremonies that
are required in connection with the <i>Kula-devat&aacute;s</i> or
family gods or goddesses. On the full moon day of <i>F&aacute;lguna</i>
the <i>Holi</i> fire is kindled and worshipped. In certain families the
full moon of <i>Chaitra</i> is considered auspicious for making
offerings to family deities. On the full moon day of
<i>Shr&aacute;van</i> is observed the feast of Cocoanut day, and on
this day Br&aacute;hmans put on new sacred threads. The full moon is
considered by the <i>Sany&aacute;sis</i> or ascetics an auspicious day
for shaving their heads. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb5" href="#pb5"
name="pb5">5</a>]</span></p>
<p>On the new moon day the <i>Pitras</i> or Manes are worshipped.
Lighted lamps are worshipped on the new moon day, of
<i>Ash&aacute;dha</i>. In the Kolh&aacute;pur State this is called
<i>Tadali</i> new moon day, and in the Konkan it is called
<i>Divali</i> new moon day. On the new moon day of <i><span class=
"corr" id="xd27e886" title="Source: Ashwin">Ashvin</span></i>, Lakshmi
the goddess of wealth is worshipped. All special ceremonies for the
propitiation of the <i>Bhutas</i> or evil spirits are usually performed
on the new moon day. The <i>Dwitiya</i> or 2nd day of every month is
considered sacred to the moon, and on this day the moon is worshipped;
while the <i>Chaturthi</i> is considered sacred to the god Ganapati,
and on the <span class="corr" id="xd27e899" title=

special festival is held in honour of the god Ganpati.<a class=

<p>On the 15th day of the bright half of the month of <i><span class=

put milk in the rays of the moon for some time, and then, after
offering it to the moon, they drink it. Drinking milk in this way is
called drinking the rays of the moon.<a class="noteref" id=

held regarding the spots on the surface of the moon. Some believe that
the spot observed on the moon is a tamarind tree in which that god has

occasioned by the hoof of the horse of King Nala. Some say that the
spot on the surface of the moon represents a <i>Pipal</i> tree and a
cow fastened to the roots of the tree; others on the authority of Hindu
mythology suppose that God created <i>Madan</i> (cupid) from the
essence taken from the body of the moon and hence the moon-god has
spots on his body.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e952src" href="#xd27e952"

<p>The people of the Th&aacute;na District hold similar notions
regarding the spots on the surface of the moon. It has been said by
some that the portion in question represents mud, while others say that
the moon has been disfigured owing to a curse from a sage.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e970src" href="#xd27e970" name="xd27e970src">46</a>
Some people say that the spots are due to the moon being cursed by his
preceptor Brahaspati with whose wife the moon-god had connection. Being
unable to bear the pain of the spots, the moon, it is said, propitiated
his preceptor, who directed him to bathe in the Bhima river to
alleviate the agony. Accordingly the pain was assuaged, and the part of
the river where the Moon-god bathed thus came to be called <i>Chandra
bh&aacute;ga</i>.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e976src" href="#xd27e976"

<p>People have various ideas about the cause of the eclipses of the sun
and the moon. Some say that the sun and the moon are superior deities,
and that the demons R&aacute;hu and Ketu who belong to the caste of
M&aacute;ngs attempt to touch them and to devour them. Others believe
that the planets R&aacute;hu and Ketu stand in the path of the Sun and
the Moon and thereby darkness is caused on the earth. It is believed
that about 5 hours before the commencement of the obscuration, in the
case of the Sun and about 4 hours in the case of the Moon, the
<i>Vedha</i> or malign influence of the monsters begins and during the
period till the whole eclipse is over a strict fast is observed. At the
commencement of the eclipse, as well as at its close, people bathe.
Some sit on a low wooden stool with a rosary in their hands repeating
the names of the gods, or the <i>g&aacute;yatri</i> or some of the
<i>mantras</i>. But those who want to acquire the art of magic or
witch-craft or the power of removing the evil effects of snake-poison,
or scorpion sting, go to a lonely place on the riverside, and there
standing in water repeat the <i>mantras</i> taught to them by their
<i>guru</i> or teacher. People give alms to Mah&aacute;rs and
M&aacute;ngs on this occasion, and therefore persons of this class go
about the streets saying loudly &ldquo;Give us alms and the eclipse
will be over<span class="corr" title="Not in source">.</span>&rdquo;
<i>De d&aacute;n sut&eacute; gir&aacute;n.</i></p>
<p>A strict fast is observed on an eclipse day, but children and
pregnant women who cannot bear the privation are given something to eat
under a <i>sike</i>. The eclipse time is so inauspicious that children
and animals born at that time are considered unlucky.<a class="noteref"
id="xd27e1505src" href="#xd27e1505" name="xd27e1505src">86</a>
Sometimes an eclipse cannot be observed owing to the intervention of
clouds. On that occasion the people of the Konkan resort to the
following expedient in order to ascertain whether the luminary is
eclipsed or not. They take a potful of water and hold in it a
<i>musal</i>. If it stands in the pot unsupported it is regarded as
indicative of the existence of an eclipse. M&aacute;ngs, Mah&aacute;rs,
etc., are supposed to be the descendants of R&aacute;hu and Ketu; and
for this reason gifts are made to them in charity on an eclipse
day.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e1514src" href="#xd27e1514" name=

<p>The popular cause of an eclipse in the Kol&aacute;ba <span class=

<i>Girha</i>, a minor deity which is said to wander through the sky and

<p>The planets and stars are worshipped by the Hindus. It is believed
that a person who is to die within six months cannot see the polar
star. From the movements of the planets past and future events of
one&rsquo;s career are foretold by Br&aacute;hman and other
astrologers. And as it is believed that man&rsquo;s good and bad luck
are dependant upon the influence of the planets, offerings of various
kinds are made and sacrifices performed for securing the favour of the
<i>Navagrahas</i> or the nine planets. In order to avert the effect of
the evil influence of certain planets people sometimes wear rings of
those precious stones which are supposed to be the favourites of the
planets.</p>
<p>The <span class="corr" id="xd27e1590" title=
"Source: rainbow">rain-bow</span> is called <i>Indra dhanushya</i> or
the Indra&rsquo;s bow, and it is believed that if the rain-bow appears
in the east, it indicates the coming of more rain, and if it appears in
the west it is a sure sign of the close of the monsoon.</p>
<p>The milky way is believed to be the heavenly Ganges. Well known
tradition relates how W&aacute;man (the 5th incarnation of Vishnu) went
to Bali the king of the lower regions and asked him to give him land
measuring three feet only. The king consented, whereupon the god
W&aacute;man enlarged his body to such an extent that by his one
footstep he occupied the whole earth and by the second he occupied
heaven. Upon this the god Brahma worshipped the foot of the god Vishnu
which was in heaven, and from that foot sprang the heavenly Ganges
which flows in heaven and is called Dudha Ganga or the milky
Ganges.</p>
<p>The worship of stars and planets is in vogue among Konkan Hindu
families of the higher castes. The polar star in particular is seen and
worshipped by the bride and the bridegroom after the ceremony at the
marriage altar is over.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e1600src" href=
"#xd27e1600" name="xd27e1600src">96</a> A very interesting story is
connected with the polar star. By the great power of his penance the
sage Vishv&aacute;mitra despatched king Trishanku to Heaven, but the
gods hurled him down. Thereupon Vishv&aacute;mitra became enraged and
began to create a new heaven. Hindu mythological books say that he thus
created the sages Vashista, Angiras, Pulah, Pulastya, Rutu, Atri, and
Marichi, and stationed Trishanku in the sky. The <i>Nava-grahas</i> or
the nine planets are worshipped before the commencement of all

person in need of money used to place before her image as large a heap
of flowers as he wanted gold, stating that he would return the gold
when he had done with it. He used then to go home and return on an
appointed day for the gold, which was sure to be found where he had
placed the heap of flowers. Once a man failed to return the gold, and
thenceforth the goddess withheld her bounty. There is no door to the
temple of this goddess. It is only through a hole in a big stone that
one can have a view of her image. Sweet scent is said to be continually
emitted from this hole. The goddess is said to have fastened the door
of her temple for the following reason. One day the goddess was walking
at the foot of the hill at night. A cowherd who happened to be there
was bewitched by her matchless beauty and fell a prey to evil desire.
He pursued her to the top of the hill, when the goddess, divining his
motive, fastened the door of her temple with a prodigious stone. On the
same hill is a cattle shed in which fresh cow-dung is said to be always
found. This place being inaccessible to cows and other quadrupeds, the

<p>At a short distance from Chaul in the Kol&aacute;ba District is a
hill dedicated to the god Dattatraya, in whose honour a great fair is
held annually. The following story is told in connection with this
hill. In ancient times a Br&aacute;hman used to practise austerities on
this hill near a <i>Tulsi</i> plant (the place on which the present
temple stands). He used to spend the whole day there, but returned home
at nightfall. On his way home fearful scenes were often presented to
him, and in his dreams he was asked not to go there any more. But the
Br&aacute;hman was obdurate. He persisted in his resolution to practise
austerities for a number of years, and at last succeeded in obtaining a
personal interview with the god Dattatraya, who commanded him to bow
down to his feet (<i>p&aacute;duka</i>). From that time pious men live
on this hill and offer their prayers to the god Dattatraya. Nearly four
hundred steps have been constructed for the ascent of this hill, and
additional steps are being built every year. Here also are some springs
of pure water. It is worth while to note that the <i>puj&aacute;ri</i>
of this god is a Shudra by caste.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e2232src"

going to be born on earth.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e2670src" href=

over the house and is established at the time of the housewarming or
<i>W&aacute;stu</i> ceremony.</p>
<p>The principal <i>Gr&aacute;ma-devat&aacute;s</i> are Hanum&aacute;n
or M&aacute;ruti, K&aacute;lika, Amba, W&aacute;ghoba, Chedoba,
Mhasoba, Bahiroba or Bhairav, Ganesh, Vira, Mh&aacute;lsa or Maha
Lakshmi, Ch&aacute;munda, Vet&aacute;l, Khandoba Malh&aacute;ri
Jog&aacute;i, Bhaw&aacute;ni, and W&aacute;geshwari and Shiva. In most
villages the chief village god is M&aacute;ruti or Hanum&aacute;n,
whose temple is situated at the entrance of the village. M&aacute;ruti
is considered to be an <i>avat&aacute;r</i> or incarnation of Shiva,
and is held in great reverence by all classes. A festival or
<i>jatra</i> is held in honour of Hanum&aacute;n on the bright half of
the month of <i>Chaitra</i>. On this occasion the temple is decorated
with ever-greens, and flowers, the stone image of the god is newly
painted or covered with red lead and oil, and garlands of the
<i>Rui</i> (Gigantic snake wort) flowers are placed round the neck of
the image, cocoanuts, plantains, <span class="corr" id="xd27e2760"
title="Source: betel-nuts">betelnuts</span> and leaves are offered to
the god, camphor is lighted and waved round the image, incense is
burnt, cooked food and sweets are offered, and money presents are made.
Every worshipper brings with him some oil, red-lead or <i>Cendur</i>, a
cocoanut, a <i>vid&aacute;-sup&aacute;ri</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, two betel
leaves, one <span class="corr" id="xd27e2772" title=

<i>Rui</i> flowers. These are given to the temple ministrant, who
offers a part of the oil and red lead to the deity, places the garland
round the deity&rsquo;s neck, and, breaking the cocoanut into pieces,
gives a piece or two to the devotee as the <i>pras&aacute;d</i> or
favoured gift of the deity. Saturday is the sacred day of the monkey
god M&aacute;ruti. Every Saturday fresh oil and red lead are offered to
the god by the devotees. The <i>Puj&aacute;ris</i> in most of the
temples of M&aacute;ruti are Guravs, Gh&aacute;dis, <span class="corr"

<p>Every Saturday in the month of <i>Shr&aacute;van</i> (August),
called the <i>Sampat Shaniw&aacute;r</i> or the wealth-giving Saturday
a special <i>puja</i> or worship is performed in the temples of
M&aacute;ruti in Bombay as well as in the Konkan. On this day people
fast the whole day and dine in the evening, after offering the god
Hanum&aacute;n or M&aacute;ruti a preparation of rice and pulse called
<i>khichadi</i> and cakes made of <i>udid</i> flour called
<i>vade</i>.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e2809src" href="#xd27e2809"

<p>There is no village in the Konkan which has not the honour of having
a temple of the god M&aacute;ruti. M&aacute;ruti is supposed to guard
the village against evils of all kinds. Care is therefore taken to
build the temple of M&aacute;ruti at the outskirts of the
village.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e2814src" href="#xd27e2814" name=
"xd27e2814src">2</a> There is a tradition that at the time of leaving
the Dandaka forest (the present Mah&aacute;r&aacute;shtra), R&aacute;ma
asked M&aacute;ruti to reside therein. It is for this reason, the
people say, that every village in the Konkan and on the Gh&aacute;ts
has a temple of M&aacute;ruti.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e2820src"

his bravery. In days gone by he utilized his strength for the
protection of Saints, Rishis, Br&aacute;hmans and cows, and for this
merit he was elevated to the rank of a Hindu god. Every Hindu village
or locality is supposed to possess at least one temple of the god
M&aacute;ruti, and in Mah&aacute;r&aacute;shtra M&aacute;ruti is the
guardian of every village. He is a <i><span class="corr" id="xd27e2836"

and is one of the seven heroes who are believed to be

M&aacute;ruti is supposed to be the originator of the
<i>Mantra-Sh&aacute;stra</i>, by the study and repetition of which one
obtains strength and superhuman power. Women desirous of getting
children go to the temple of M&aacute;ruti, and there burn before his
image lamps made of wheat flour and filled with ghi. The image of
Hanum&aacute;n is represented in temples in two ways, that is (1)
V&iacute;ra Hanum&aacute;n or Warrior Hanum&aacute;n, (2)
D&aacute;sa-Hanum&aacute;n or servant Hanum&aacute;n. The former is
found in a temple consecrated to the worship of the god Hanum&aacute;n
alone, whereas the latter is found in a temple dedicated to the worship
of the god R&aacute;ma.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e2855src" href=
"#xd27e2855" name="xd27e2855src">7</a> Since M&aacute;ruti is the god
of strength, gymnasts tie an image of M&aacute;ruti to their wrists,
and they also consecrate an image of M&aacute;ruti in their gymnasiums.
The number eleven is said to be dear and sacred to him because he is
believed to be an incarnation of the eleven Rudras. The birth day of
the god M&aacute;ruti which falls on the 15th of the bright half of
<i>Chaitra</i>, called the <i>Hanum&aacute;n Jayanti</i> day, is
celebrated in the Kolh&aacute;pur District with great reverence. Those
who wish to have a son draw the figure of M&aacute;ruti on a wall in
red-lead, and worship it daily with sandal paste, flowers and garlands
of <i>Rui</i>. Others burn lamps made of wheat flour before the image
of the god. Persons who are under the evil influence of the planets,
and especially of the <span class="corr" id="xd27e2868" title=
"Source: planets">planet</span> Saturn, worship the god Hanum&aacute;n
on Saturdays in order to propitiate the planets. On this day they make
wreaths of the leaves and flowers of the <i>Rui</i> plant and adorn his
neck with them. They also offer him <i>udid</i> (Phaseolus radiatus)
and salt. The story told of M&aacute;ruti is that Anjani his mother
pleased the god Shiva with her penance, and when the god asked her to
claim a boon, she requested that Shiva himself should be born as her
son. Shiva therefore took birth in her womb and manifested himself as
Hanum&aacute;n or M&aacute;ruti<a class="noteref" id="xd27e2877src"

Thus the god R&aacute;ma at N&aacute;sik, Vithoba at Pandharpur,
Krishna at Dw&aacute;rka, Mah&aacute;lakshmi at Kolwan, <span class=

M&aacute;him, and Khandoba or Khander&aacute;i at Jejuri.</p>
<p>Khander&aacute;i is said to be an incarnation of the god Shiva.
Khander&aacute;i killed the demon Mani-Malla who was devastating the
earth, and he is therefore called Mall&aacute;ri or Malh&aacute;ri.
Kunbis and lower class Hindus in the Konkan as well as in the Deccan
occasionally make a vow to the god Khandoba that if their desire is
fulfilled they will offer their first born male or female child to the
service of the god. The male child thus dedicated to Khandoba is called
W&aacute;ghya and the female is called Murali. The W&aacute;ghya and
Murali do not engage in any business, but maintain themselves by
begging in the streets in the name of the god Khander&aacute;i. Though
they are not actually married, the <span class="corr" id="xd27e2894"
title="Source: W&aacute;ghy&aacute;s">W&aacute;ghyas</span> and Muralis
live as husband and wife, and their progeny are also called
W&aacute;ghyas and Muralis. They repeat the sacred cry <i>jai
khander&aacute;y&aacute;cha Elkot</i>, and give to people
<i>bel-bhand&aacute;r</i> of Khander&aacute;i consisting of the sacred
<i>Bel</i> leaves and turmeric powder. The god Khander&aacute;i is the
family deity of some Deshasth Br&aacute;hmans, who perform a family
rite <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb23" href="#pb23" name=
"pb23">23</a>]</span>called <i>Tali bharane</i> <span lang=
"ma">&#2340;&#2355;&#2368; &#2349;&#2352;&#2339;&#2375;</span> on every
<i>purnima</i> or full moon day. The rite is as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>A <i>tali</i> or plate is filled with cocoanuts, fruits, betel nuts,
saffron, turmeric or <i><span class="corr" id="xd27e2924" title=
"Source: bel-bh&aacute;nd&aacute;r">bel-bhand&aacute;r</span></i>, etc.
Then a pot is filled with water, and on its mouth a cocoanut is placed.
This cocoanut, with the pot, is then worshipped with flowers, sandal
paste, etc., a lighted lamp filled with ghi is put in the same place,
and the <i>tali</i> is waved thrice round the pot, which is supposed to
contain the god Khandoba. Five persons then lift up the cocoanut with
the <i>tali</i> and place it three times on the pot, repeating each
time the words <i>Elkot</i> or <i>Khande r&aacute;y&aacute;cha
Elkot</i>. The cocoanut is then broken into pieces, mixed with sugar or
<i>j&aacute;gri</i>, and is distributed among friends and relations as
<i>pras&aacute;d</i>. On this occasion, as well as on the occasions of
all <i>Kuladharmas</i>, that is, the days fixed for performing the
special worship of the family goddess or family god of each family, the
ceremony called the <i>Gondhal</i> dance is performed. On the same
occasion another ceremony called <i>Bodan</i> is performed by the
Deshasths and by the Chitp&aacute;vans. It is as follows:&mdash; An
image of the family deity is placed in a pot or plate called
<i>t&aacute;mhan</i>, and it is then bathed in the
<i>panch&aacute;mrit</i>, that is, the five holy things, <i>viz.</i>,
milk, curds, ghi, honey and sugar. Sandalpaste is offered to it as well
as flowers, lighted lamps and some sweets and incense. Five women whose
husbands are alive then prepare five lamps of wheat flour called
<i>Kuranandi</i> and wave them thrice round the face of the goddess or
god, as the case may be. All the limps are then placed in the plate or
<i>t&aacute;mhan</i> in which the deity is kept, and the
<i>panch&aacute;mrita</i> and other materials of worship and food and
sweet cakes are mixed together. Occasionally one of the five women
becomes possessed with the spirit of the <i>kula-devi</i> or family
deity, and confers blessings on the members of the family for their
devotion. It is believed that those families which fail to perform
periodically the <i>Bodan</i>, <i>Tali</i> and <i>Gondhal</i>
ceremonies in honour of their tutelary deity are sure to suffer, from
some misfortune or calamity during the year.<a class="noteref" id=

before undertaking any important business they obtain the consent or
take the omen of the deity. This ceremony is known as <i>kaul

or flowers are taken and one of them is placed on the right side of the
deity and the other on the left side. The worshipper then bows before
the deity and requests her to let the nut on the right side fall first
if the deity is pleased to consent, if not, to let the nut on the left
side fall first. Naturally one of the two nuts falls first, and they
interpret this as either consent or dissent as the case may be. The
villagers have so much faith in this <i>kaul</i> that they make use of
this method of divination to ascertain whether sick or diseased persons
will recover or die. Special sacrifices are offered to these local

with <i>Amani</i> trees and formed a pasture for cattle. The cow of a
certain man of the village daily used to go to graze at this place. The
cow used to give milk twice, but one day she gave milk only once, and
thereafter she continued to give milk only once a day. The owner
therefore asked the <i>Gavali</i> or cowherd to ascertain the cause of
this sudden change. One day the cowherd noticed that the cow allowed
her milk to drop upon a stone. At this the cowherd was so enraged that
he struck the stone with his scythe so hard that it was cloven in two
and blood gushed forth. He hurriedly repaired to the village and
related this wonderful phenomenon to the people. The villagers came to
the spot, and decided to build a temple to the god Shiva over the
stone. One part of the stone is in this temple and the other part was
taken to the village of Kalamburi, where another temple was built over

Konkan, but the hero Bhima, like M&aacute;ruti, is held in reverence by
the gymnasts. Bhima is not worshipped, but a work called the
<i>Bhima-stavar&aacute;j</i> is read at the bed of a dying man in order

<p>Wherever a village is founded, it is customary to establish a
village deity as the guardian of the village. The deities chosen are
M&aacute;ruti, K&aacute;li, Chandk&aacute;i, Varadani, etc. In the
Konkan, goddesses are preferred, and on the Ghats generally
M&aacute;ruti is preferred. Certain ceremonies are performed for
consecrating the place to the deity, and sometimes the deity is called
after the village as Marleshwar<a class="noteref" id="xd27e3270src"
href="#xd27e3270" name="xd27e3270src">40</a> etc. By many lower class
people the goddess Pondhar is often selected as the guardian of a new
village. At Shahpur, if the newly founded village is to be inhabited by
high class Hindus, the deities M&aacute;ruti and Durga are selected as
<i>gr&aacute;ma-devatas</i>, but if it is to be inhabited by lower
class people, then such deities as Mhasoba, Chedoba,
J&aacute;kh&aacute;i, etc. are chosen.<a class="noteref" id=

are chosen as village deities. Cheda is represented by a long piece of
wood or stone besmeared with red-powder, and is placed on the outskirts
of the village. No Br&aacute;hman is necessary for establishing a
Cheda. The <i>Puj&aacute;ri</i> is generally a Kunbi or M&aacute;li,

cocoanuts.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e3289src" href="#xd27e3289" name=

betelnut falls first is chosen as the deity of the new

the farmers regard one of their dead ancestors as their chief deity,
and represent him in their house by a cocoanut. They do not enter on
any new business without first offering prayers to this cocoanut, and
they also believe that they can bring evil upon their enemies by simply
cursing them before the deified cocoanut. The only materials generally
required for the worship of this cocoanut are red powder, incense and
flowers. On rare occasions, goats and fowls are sacrificed. It is
believed that the ancestor in the cocoanut likes to be worshipped by
the wife or husband (as the case may be) of the person represented by
the cocoanut. Some farmers, in addition to the cocoanut, worship a
stick or cap of their ancestor along with the cocoanut, and offer
prayers for the protection of their cattle, for good rain and harvest,
and also for the destruction of their enemies.<a class="noteref" id=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">At Vengurla, in the Ratn&aacute;giri District, when
epidemic diseases prevail, the people of the village assemble and
prepare a basket in which are placed cooked rice, cocoanuts, lemons,
wine, red flowers and <i>Udid</i> (Phaseolus radiatus) grain. The
basket is then carried out of the village along with a cock or a goat,
and deposited outside the village boundary. To carry this basket, a
person belonging to the <span class="corr" id="xd27e3530" title=
"Source: Mahar">Mah&aacute;r</span> caste is generally selected. The
people of the next village similarly carry the basket beyond their
village limits; and it is finally thrown into the sea. It is believed
that if the basket of offerings to the disease-deities is carried from
one village to another, it is sure to bring the disease with it. Great
care is therefore taken to throw the offerings into the sea. In cases
of small pox a feast is given to women whose husbands are alive. In
some cases boiled rice is mixed with the blood of a cock, and on the
rice is placed a burning black cotton wick in a cocoanut shell with a
little oil in it. The whole is then carried beyond the village boundary
and thrown away.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e3533src" href="#xd27e3533"
name="xd27e3533src">1</a> In the village of <span class="corr" title=
"Source: Mitb&aacute;v">Mithb&aacute;v</span> in the Ratn&aacute;giri
District, epidemic diseases like cholera, small pox, plague, etc., are
supposed to come from disease deities, and in order to avoid the danger
of such diseases the people of the village go to the temple of the
village deity and pray for protection. The special form of worship on
such occasions is the <i>Kaul</i><span class="corr" title=
"Not in source">,</span> <i>i.e.</i>, asking a favour from the deity.
When an epidemic of plague broke out for the first time at <span class=
"corr" id="xd27e3548" title="Source: Sangmeshwar">Sangameshwar</span>,
the people of the village at once proceeded to worship the village
deity; but a few cases of plague occurred, even after worshipping the
village goddess <i>J&aacute;khm&aacute;ta</i>. When the people went to
the temple and asked the reason why the plague continued, it was
announced by the deity through the temple ministrant that she was
helpless in the case of plague, and desired the people to worship the
god Shiva, thereby signifying that the village deity has limited
powers, and that the power of averting great evils lies with Shiva the
god of destruction.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e3554src" href=
"#xd27e3554" name="xd27e3554src">2</a> In the Devgad Taluka of the
Ratn&aacute;giri District in epidemic diseases like cholera, etc., the
usual ceremony, <i>i.e.</i>, the <i>Paradi</i> (disease-scaring basket)
is performed. A basket containing boiled rice, red powder, red flowers,
lemons, betel nuts, betel leaves, etc., is prepared, and on that rice
is kept a burning cotton wick dipped in oil. The basket is then carried
beyond the village boundary along with a goat having a red flower
garland round its neck. The goat is set free at the outskirts of the
village. In cases of small pox, married women whose husbands are alive
are worshipped with turmeric powder, cocoanuts, flowers, etc., and
incense is kept burning in the house. The deity of small pox is also
specially worshipped for a number of days. It is represented by a brass
or copper <i>lota</i> with a cocoanut placed over it. This process is
called <i>m&aacute;nd bharane</i> <i>i.e.</i> arranging the materials
of worship. The girls in the house sing songs in praise of the small
pox deity. It is believed that in this way the severity of the disease
is reduced.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e3576src" href="#xd27e3576" name=
"xd27e3576src">3</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb30" href="#pb30"

<p>In the Sangameshwar taluka of the Ratn&aacute;giri District, when
epidemic diseases prevail, the people of the village assemble in the
temple of the village deity, offer a cocoanut to the goddess, and ask
for a <i>Kaul</i> (omen). After receiving the <i>Kaul</i> they pray for
mercy. It is believed that if the <i>Kaul</i> is in favour of the
people the diseases will disappear.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e3591src"
href="#xd27e3591" name="xd27e3591src">4</a> At Achare in the
M&aacute;lwan taluka of the Ratn&aacute;giri District it is believed
that epidemic diseases such as cholera, small pox, etc., are caused by
the anger of the deities <i>Jari</i> and <i>Mari</i>; and in order to
satisfy those deities animal sacrifices are offered at the time of
their worship. There are no other deities who cause such
diseases.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e3604src" href="#xd27e3604" name=
"xd27e3604src">5</a> At Vijayadurg in the Ratn&aacute;giri District, in
cases of small pox, the child suffering from the disease is made to
sleep on a silk garment <i>Sovalen</i>. Flowers are thrown upon the
patient&rsquo;s body, and are given to him to smell. Incense is burnt
in the house. On the seventh day from the beginning of the disease, the
child is first bathed in milk and then in water. Black scented powder
called <i>Abir</i> is thrown on the body. After two or three days an
image representing the deity is made of flour, which is worshipped, and
a feast is given to Br&aacute;hmans and unwidowed women.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e3613src" href="#xd27e3613" name=
"xd27e3613src">6</a></p>
<p>At Basani in the Ratn&aacute;giri District the disease of small pox
is averted by a Br&aacute;hman worshipping the goddess <i>Shitala</i>.
Br&aacute;hmans are also worshipped, and a feast is given to them. In
cases of cholera and the other epidemic diseases the village deity is
worshipped and sacrifices are made to her.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e3621src" href="#xd27e3621" name="xd27e3621src">7</a></p>
<p>At Kochare in the Vengurla taluka of the Ratn&aacute;giri District,
a woman whose husband is alive is made to represent the goddess <i>Jari
Mari</i>, and is worshipped with flowers, red powder <i>Kunku</i> and
black ointment <i>K&aacute;jal</i>. She is given a feast of sweet
things; and rice and cocoanuts are put into her lap by another woman
whose husband is alive. She is then carried in procession through the
village with beating of drums and the singing of songs. This is similar
to the <i>Paradi</i> procession, which is also common in that
District.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e3638src" href="#xd27e3638" name=
"xd27e3638src">8</a></p>
<p>At Navare in the Ratn&aacute;giri District, in cases of small pox,
the diseased child and the person into whose body the small pox deities
called <i>B&aacute;y&aacute;s</i> enter, are worshipped with
<i>Abir</i> black scented powder, flower garlands, &amp;c.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e3649src" href="#xd27e3649" name=
"xd27e3649src">9</a></p>
<p>At Pendur in the M&aacute;lwan taluka of the Ratn&aacute;giri
District the wrath of the female deities or
<i>M&aacute;trik&aacute;s</i> is supposed to be the cause of epidemic
diseases, and these <i>M&aacute;trik&aacute;s</i> are accordingly
worshipped for their pacification.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e3660src"
href="#xd27e3660" name="xd27e3660src">10</a></p>
<p>At Chaul in the Kol&aacute;ba District the god Shankar is worshipped
by Br&aacute;hmans when epidemic diseases prevail in a village. The
worship consists in repeating <i>Vedic</i> hymns. The nine planets are
also propitiated by sacrifices of boiled rice, etc. There is a famous
temple of the goddess Shitala at Chaul where the deity is worshipped by
Br&aacute;hmans, who recite <i>Vedic</i> hymns, whenever small pox
prevails in the village. The <i>mantras</i> of the goddess and the
Shitala <i>Ashtaka</i> are also repeated in the <i>Paur&aacute;nic</i>
style. The women walk round the temple every day as long as the signs
of the disease are visible on their children. The goddess is worshipped
with turmeric and red powders, and clothes and fruits are given to her.
The <i>Kaul</i> ceremony is also practised in this District. It is
worth noticing that even Musalm&aacute;ns ask for a <i>Kaul</i> from
this goddess. The days fixed for <i>Kaul</i> are:&mdash;Sunday,
Tuesday, Thursday and Friday. The morning hours are considered
specially auspicious <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb31" href="#pb31"
name="pb31">31</a>]</span>for the <i>Kaul</i>. There is another temple
at Chaul, of the goddess Shri Gol&aacute;ba <i>Devi</i>. This goddess
is also worshipped when other epidemic diseases prevail in the village.

cause them displeasure. There, the profession of a sorcerer or exorcist
is not hereditary. Any one who learns the wicked <i>mantras</i> after
attending regularly the burial and burning grounds for some days
becomes an expert, and may follow the profession.<a class="noteref" id=

M&aacute;lwan taluka of the Ratn&aacute;giri District the chief
function of the village sorcerer is to worship the village deity. All
kinds of gifts and presents intended for the deity are made through
him. His profession is hereditary <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb36"

ignorant people<a class="noteref" id="xd27e4157src" href="#xd27e4157"

generally selected.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e4163src" href=

<p>In the Vengurla taluka of the Ratn&aacute;giri District, the chief
function of the village sorcerer is to find remedies for the cure of
persons suffering from evil spirits. His position among the people of
the low classes is considered high. He follows the hereditary
profession of a sorcerer, and generally the eldest son succeeds his
father.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e4168src" href="#xd27e4168" name=

<p>At Chidhran in the Panwel taluka of the Kol&aacute;ba District,
Bhutes, a caste of beggars, are the devotees of a goddess. Some of them
are called <i>Bhagats</i>. <i>Devrishis</i> are very rare. The
difference between a <i>Devrishi</i> and a <i>Bhagat</i> is as
follows:&mdash;A <i>Devrishi</i> removes the evil spirits by simply
repeating the <i>mantras</i> while the <i>Bhagat</i> removes them by
bringing the evil spirit into his own body and by dancing,
etc.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e4195src" href="#xd27e4195" name=
"xd27e4195src">62</a></p>
<p>At Chaul in the Kol&aacute;ba District, Bhutes go begging in the
morning every day for the first nine days of the month of
<i><span class="corr" id="xd27e4204" title=
"Source: Ashwin">Ashvin</span></i> (October). On the tenth day the
Bhutya is given a pice from every house. These Bhutes are devotees of
the goddess Shakti. At Sasawane in the Kol&aacute;ba District the
village sorcerer comes to beg every day and is given rice, etc., but
during the first nine days of the bright half of <i><span class="corr"
id="xd27e4208" title="Source: Ashwin">Ashvin</span></i> (October) he is
given copper coins.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e4211src" href=
"#xd27e4211" name="xd27e4211src">63</a> At Anjur in the Th&aacute;na
District the devotee of a particular god is called <i>Bhagat</i>, and
one who knows how to summon or eject evil spirits is called Bhutya. A
Devrishi is a person who knows the <i>mantras</i> for warding off the
great evil spirits such as <i>Brahma R&aacute;kshasa</i>, <i>Brahma
Samband</i>, etc. These three classes are respected only for performing
their respective duties, and not otherwise.<a class="noteref" id=

<p>At Kolh&aacute;pur, the sorcerer is never appointed. His functions
are to ask a <i>kaul</i> from the deity, to pray for the welfare of the
people, and explain to them what he sees in his dreams. He holds no
position in higher society, but the poor people who believe in him are
afraid of him. Sorcerers are generally very cunning; they frighten poor
people, and obtain from them presents and gifts for their
maintenance.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e4235src" href="#xd27e4235"

on certain occasions offerings of coins and cocoanuts are made. It is
believed that when the three kinds of trees happen to grow together,
<i>i.e.</i>, close to each other, near a well or on the bank of a
river, the god Datta resides there, but such cases are very rare. These
trees are supposed to be the haunts of the <i>Munja</i> spirit, and
therefore copper coins waved round the persons suffering from evil

on Monday, the women worship the <i>Pipal</i> tree, and on the full
moon day of <i>Jestha</i> (June) they worship the Banyan tree. The
custom prevails of the worship of a well by women after their delivery.
A woman, after completing the period of her confinement or ceremonial
impurity, is taken to a well, from which she has to bring home water,
and is required to worship the well with the following materials,
<i>viz<span class="corr" title=

three successive days, from the 13th to the 15th day of the bright half
of <i>Jestha</i> (June). The <i>Pipal</i> tree is worshipped daily by
some men and women of the Br&aacute;hman caste. Women walk round this
tree for a hundred and eight times or more daily. Some persons hold a
thread ceremony for the Pipal tree in order to obtain a son, and
worship the tree for a certain period. It is worshipped with fruit and
copper coins. Wooden cradles are also offered to the tree. Wells are

<p>At Kolh&aacute;pur, the Banyan and <i>Pipal</i> trees are considered
very holy, and offerings of rags, coins, etc., are made to them. It is
a custom among the Hindu women to worship the Banyan tree on the full
moon day of <i>Jestha</i>. Offerings of cloth and fruit are made to
this tree, and copper or silver coins are given as <i>dakshana</i>.
Some women make a small model in gold, silver, or copper of the Banyan

<p>At N&aacute;gothane in the Kol&aacute;ba District, it is believed
that men who are well versed in the <i>mantras</i> of witchcraft and
sorcery sometimes transfer diseases from one person to
another.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e4406src" href="#xd27e4406" name=

<p>At M&aacute;l&aacute;d in the Th&aacute;na District a method of
transferring disease from one person to another is in practice among
the <i>Shudras</i>. It is as follows:&mdash;A woman without a child
cuts secretly a little piece from the garment of a woman who has
children. She then burns the piece, puts the ashes into water, and the
mixture is then drunk by the barren woman. It is believed that, by so
doing, the evil spirit of the disease that is troubling the barren
woman is transferred to the other who has children. The barrenness of
the first woman then disappears, and she begets children. It is said
that if the second woman comes to know of the mischief before using
that garment, she discontinues the use of the same, and no harm is done
to her.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e4417src" href="#xd27e4417" name=

transferring disease are called <i>Muth M&aacute;rane</i><span class=

<p>At Kolh&aacute;pur, there are no methods of transferring disease to
other persons, but it is said that the following ceremony is practised
in the case of persons suffering from swollen glands. Rice, <i>Udid</i>
grain etc. are tied in a yellow cloth, and three knots are made in it.
This is then kept for one night under the pillow of the diseased
person. It is taken out the next morning and thrown away at a place
where three roads meet. It is then supposed that the person who steps
on the bundle first is attacked with the disease, and the one for whom
the rite is performed is cured.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e4441src"

<p>At Devgad taluka in the Ratn&aacute;giri District it is believed
that evil spirits are fond of things like a cock, cocoanuts, boiled
rice, etc., and when a person considers himself attacked by evil
spirits, these things are waved round his body and thrown away at some
distance from his residence. This is generally done in the evening, but
if necessary it can be done at any time. The person who goes to throw
these things away is prohibited from looking behind. The things
required for a <i>bali</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, oblation, on such occasions
are boiled rice, red powder, and an oil lamp made of black cotton

<p>At Kolh&aacute;pur, the use of fowls, goats, limes, cocoanuts,
copper coins, dry chillies and salt is in vogue, not only in cases of
sick persons, but also when a person performs a feat such as bending an
iron bar, or doubling with his hands a silver coin, or winning a
victory in wrestling. The articles are then waved round him and thrown
away in order that he may not suffer from an evil eye. Among the rich

<h2 class="main"><i>WORSHIP OF ANCESTORS AND SAINTS.</i></h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In the Konkan, especially among the lower classes, a
strong belief prevails regarding the mortality of the spirits of the
dead and of their re-appearance or re-birth in their children. And for
this reason, as well as for protection against evil, the dead ancestors
are worshipped.</p>
<p>The custom regarding the worship of ancestors prevailing at
K&aacute;lshe in the Ratn&aacute;giri District is as follows:&mdash;The
worship of ancestors is called <i>Shr&aacute;ddha</i> (anniversary). It
is performed on the no moon day of every month, on the date of the
death of the person every year, and also on the same date of the dark
half of the month of <i>Bh&aacute;drapada</i> (September). Among the
Br&aacute;hmans, Br&aacute;hman priests are invited, worshipped, and
are given a feast, after worshipping balls of boiled rice as
representing the dead ancestors. The special materials used for worship
are sesamum and barley grain. The same custom prevails among
non-Br&aacute;hmans with the exception that the balls are made of rice
flour and not of boiled rice. To partake of the food on such occasions,
the lower classes invite married persons of their own caste. The
anniversary day of <i>S&aacute;dhus</i> and <i>Mahants</i>,
<i>i.e.</i><span class="corr" title="Not in source">,</span> saints, is
called <i>Punya tithi</i><span class="corr" title=
"Not in source">,</span> <i>i.e.</i><span class="corr" title=
"Not in source">,</span> the day of merit.</p>
<p>It is commonly believed that spirits are mortal. The life of the
deceased remains in the spirit condition until the sins which he may
have committed are washed away by the good deeds of his descendants.
There is no belief that one spirit dies and another takes its place,
but it is believed that the ancestors are sometimes reborn in the same
family.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e4585src" href="#xd27e4585" name=
"xd27e4585src">1</a></p>
<p>At Ubh&aacute;d&aacute;nda in the Vengurla taluka of the
Ratn&aacute;giri District ancestors are worshipped every year on the
same date of the month (according to the Hindu calendar year) on which
the person died, by performing a <i>Shr&aacute;ddha</i> rite. They are
also worshipped on the same date in the second half of
<i>Bh&aacute;drapada</i> (September) every year. This is by a rite
called <i>Mah&aacute;laya Shr&aacute;ddha</i>. On both these occasions
Br&aacute;hmans are invited, and the worshipping ceremony is performed
by repeating the <i>mantras</i>. After the ceremony, all the invited
guests men and women partake of food.</p>
<p>S&aacute;dhus are worshipped after washing their feet with sandal
paste, flowers, cocoanuts and gifts of money.</p>
<p>It is believed that evil spirits undergo a transformation after a
lapse of twelve years. The practice of giving the names of ancestors to
children is common, and it is due to the belief that the spirits of the
dead are reborn in children in the same family.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e4609src" href="#xd27e4609" name="xd27e4609src">2</a></p>
<p>At Pendur in the Ratn&aacute;giri District the ancestors are
worshipped on the last day of every Hindu calendar month. This monthly
worship is called <i>Darsha Shr&aacute;ddha</i>. The annual
<span class="corr" id="xd27e4617" title=
"Source: anniversay">anniversary</span> of the <i>manes</i> is
celebrated by the ceremony called the <i>S&aacute;mvatsarik
Shr&aacute;ddha</i>. If any ancestor has died after becoming a recluse
or <i>Sany&aacute;si</i>, his body is <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb41" href="#pb41" name="pb41">41</a>]</span>buried, and a tomb called
a <i>sam&aacute;dhi</i> is erected over it; and his descendants,
instead of performing the annual <i>Shr&aacute;ddha</i>, worship the
tomb of the recluse every day. It is believed that the spirits take a
different form after the lapse of seven generations. The belief that
the spirits of the dead are reborn in the same family prevails among
the people of this district. The following measures are adopted for the
purpose of identification. When a person dies in a family, a basil or
<i>bel</i> leaf is placed on a certain part of the body, or some
familiar sign is made in sandal paste; and when a child is born in the
family, its body is carefully examined to ascertain whether there are
any signs on the body of the child such as were made on the dead body
of the ancestor. If the same sign appears to the satisfaction of the
members of the family, it is believed that the dead person has been
reborn in the same family.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e4641src" href=
"#xd27e4641" name="xd27e4641src">3</a></p>
<p>At Navare in the Ratn&aacute;giri District Br&aacute;hmans are
invited, worshipped and given a feast in honour of ancestors.
<i>S&aacute;dhus</i> and <i>Mahants</i>, or saints, are worshipped by
giving them the same honour accorded to the family deities.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e4652src" href="#xd27e4652" name=
"xd27e4652src">4</a></p>
<p>At Basani in the Ratn&aacute;giri District the anniversary day of
saints is observed by the performance of a <i>Bhajan</i>, which
consists in singing the good deeds of saints and in offering prayers.
It is believed that spirits are mortal, but they do not die like
ordinary human beings. They cease to exist as spirits as soon as the
period of their release is over. The spirits obtain absolution by
visiting certain holy places.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e4660src" href=
"#xd27e4660" name="xd27e4660src">5</a></p>
<p>At Dabhol in the Ratn&aacute;giri District the people believe that
the souls of ancestors are reborn in children in the same family if
some of their desires remain unfulfilled at the time of their
demise.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e4666src" href="#xd27e4666" name=
"xd27e4666src">6</a></p>
<p>At Shiravde in the Ratn&aacute;giri District ancestors are
worshipped every year by performing the rites called <i>tarpan</i>,
which consist in offering oblations of holy water, sesamum, barley
grains and repeating prayers. The <i>tarpan</i> is observed on the very
date of the month in which the person died. The procedure of
worshipping the Hindu saints is similar to that of the other deities.
Owing to the belief that the <span class="corr" id="xd27e4677" title=
"Source: spirit">spirits</span> of the dead are reborn in children in
the same family the name of the grandfather is given to the
grandson.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e4680src" href="#xd27e4680" name=
"xd27e4680src">7</a></p>
<p>At N&aacute;ringre in the Ratn&aacute;giri taluka ancestors are
worshipped by inviting Br&aacute;hman priests, and worshipping them
with sandal paste and flowers. These Br&aacute;hmans are supposed to
represent the father, grandfather and great grandfather of the
worshipper.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e4685src" href="#xd27e4685" name=
"xd27e4685src">8</a></p>
<p>At B&aacute;ndivade in the Ratn&aacute;giri District the leaves of
the herb called <i>pudina</i>, (a good medicine for worms) sesamum, and
<i>darbha</i> grass are required for the worship of ancestors. The man
who worships the ancestors has to turn his sacred thread from the right
hand to the left.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e4696src" href="#xd27e4696"
name="xd27e4696src">9</a></p>
<p>At Anjarle in the Ratn&aacute;giri District <i>Mahants</i> and
<i>S&aacute;dhus</i> are worshipped in their life-time like family
deities, and their tombs are worshipped after their death.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e4707src" href="#xd27e4707" name=
"xd27e4707src">10</a></p>
<p>At <span class="corr" title="Source: Fonde">Fonda</span> in the
Ratn&aacute;giri District ancestors are worshipped by making balls of
boiled rice on their anniversary day. The balls are supposed to take
the place of the dead parents, and they are worshipped with sandal
paste and flowers, and by burning incense and lighting a lamp of
clarified butter. Betelnuts and leaves, cocoanuts and <i>Dakshina</i>
(presents of money) are given to them. People also bow before them.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb42" href="#pb42" name=
"pb42">42</a>]</span><i>Mahants</i> and <i>S&aacute;dhus</i> are
worshipped by washing their feet, sandal paste is applied to their
body, and they are garlanded with flowers. Cocoanuts, a piece of cloth
and a gift in coins are given to them according to the means of the
giver. It is said that spirits can remain as spirits for about a
thousand years.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e4725src" href="#xd27e4725"
name="xd27e4725src">11</a></p>
<p>At Vijayadurg in the Ratn&aacute;giri District the method of
worshipping ancestors is as follows:&mdash;In some cases elderly
parents as well as a grandfather and great grandfather are also
worshipped, their feet are washed with water, and the water is accepted
as <i>tirth</i> or <span class="corr" id="xd27e4736" title=
"Source: holywater">holy water</span>. While worshipping the
<i>Mahants</i> and <i>S&aacute;dhus</i>, or saints, water is poured on
their right hand, and they are worshipped with sandal paste and
flowers, and given a <i>dakshana</i> or gifts of money according to
one&rsquo;s means and will. The <i>p&aacute;dukas</i>, or foot prints,
of saints are worshipped after their death.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e4752src" href="#xd27e4752" name="xd27e4752src">12</a></p>
<p>At <span class="corr" title=
"Source: Mitb&aacute;v">Mithb&aacute;v</span> in the Ratn&aacute;giri
District holy persons such as Sany&aacute;sis are worshipped after
their death by performing their anniversary ceremony every year. It is
believed that spirits are mortal. Evil spirits such as <i>munjas</i>,
etc., undergo a kind of transformation, and it is believed that this
occurs at places like Narsoba&rsquo;s W&aacute;di.<a class="noteref"
id="xd27e4763src" href="#xd27e4763" name="xd27e4763src">13</a></p>
<p>At Devgad in the Ratn&aacute;giri District ancestors are worshipped
on their anniversary days, the <i>manes</i> being represented by pieces
of <i>Darbha</i> grass and balls of boiled rice.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e4777src" href="#xd27e4777" name="xd27e4777src">14</a></p>
<p>At Poladpur in the Kol&aacute;ba District a person whose father is
alive but who has lost his mother&rsquo;s father, has to perform the
<i>Shr&aacute;ddha</i> of that grandfather on the 1st day of the bright
half of <i><span class="corr" id="xd27e4786" title=
"Source: Ashwin">Ashvin</span></i> (October). This
<i>Shr&aacute;ddha</i> is called <i>Duhitra</i>. A person who has lost
his wife has to perform the <i>Shr&aacute;ddha</i> for that wife on the
9th day of the dark half of the month of <i>Bh&aacute;drapada</i>. This
day is called <i>Ahev Navami</i>. These different sorts of
<i>Shr&aacute;ddhas</i> are observed only by the high class Hindus. The
lower classes worship their ancestors on the last day of the month of
<i>Bh&aacute;drapada</i> by preparing a ball of boiled rice or flour,
and putting it out for the crows to eat. It is believed that spirits
are mortal. The ceremony called <i>Narayan Nagabali</i> is performed
when it is believed that the spirit of an ancestor is giving trouble to
the family. When this rite is performed, the spirit is saved and the
ailment ceases. It is believed that the spirits of the dead are
sometimes reborn in children in the same family, and in such cases the
names of the ancestors are given to their children by the
people.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e4814src" href="#xd27e4814" name=
"xd27e4814src">15</a></p>
<p>At Khopoli in the Karjat taluka of the Kol&aacute;ba District the
form of worship of ancestors is similar to that of the ordinary Hindu
deities. In the case of the worship of the deities the person
performing the worship has to sit with his face towards the east, while
at the worship of the ancestors he has to sit with his face towards the
south.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e4819src" href="#xd27e4819" name=
"xd27e4819src">16</a></p>
<p>At Chaul in the Kol&aacute;ba District, the tombs of
<i>Sany&aacute;sis</i>, <i>i.e.</i><span class="corr" title=
"Not in source">,</span> ascetics and <i>S&aacute;dhus</i> are
worshipped on their anniversary days, and a great fair is held in their
honour. The other ancestors are worshipped by the
<i>shr&aacute;ddha</i> rites. The anniversary of the founders of the
different sects is observed by their followers by a <i>bhajan</i>,
<i>i.e.</i><span class="corr" title="Not in source">,</span> singing
songs in their own style and exhibiting the different insignia and flag
of the sect as advised by their founders.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e4848src" href="#xd27e4848" name="xd27e4848src">17</a></p>
<p>The people of Chidhran in the Kol&aacute;ba District believe that
the period for which the soul has to remain in the spirit state depends
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb43" href="#pb43" name=
"pb43">43</a>]</span>upon the sins of the person, or the wishes which
remained unfulfilled during his life time. It is not that all the
spirits of the dead are reborn in children. The rebirth depends upon
the good or bad deeds of the deceased. However, if the nature of any
child suggests the nature of any dead person in the family, it is
assumed that the spirit of the deceased has returned to the
family.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e4855src" href="#xd27e4855" name=
"xd27e4855src">18</a></p>
<p>At N&aacute;gothane in the Pen taluka of the Kol&aacute;ba District
some of the communities worship small images called <i>t&aacute;nks</i>
on the anniversary of their ancestors&rsquo; death; among the
<i>Shudras</i> food is given to the crows on the last day of
<i>Bh&aacute;drapad</i>. The custom of giving a grandfather&rsquo;s
name to the grandson prevails largely, and is due to the belief that
the spirits of the dead are sometimes reborn in the same
family.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e4869src" href="#xd27e4869" name=
"xd27e4869src">19</a> It is also said that in some of the Hindu
communities, if a child cries continuously, ashes are applied to its
forehead in the name of one of the ancestors in the family; and if the
child sleeps quietly or stops crying, the name of that ancestor is
given to it.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e4872src" href="#xd27e4872"
name="xd27e4872src">20</a></p>
<p>At Shirgaon in the Th&aacute;na District, the worship of ancestors
is performed on the day of the father&rsquo;s death, every year. On any
auspicious occasion the rite called <i>Nandi shr&aacute;ddha</i> is
performed at the beginning of the ceremony. It is believed that evil
spirits or ghosts have to remain in the ghostly state for about one
thousand years, or at least until one of the descendants in the family
goes to a holy place like <i>K&aacute;shi</i> (Benares) and there
performs the <i>shr&aacute;ddha</i> rites of his ancestors.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e4886src" href="#xd27e4886" name=
"xd27e4886src">21</a></p>
<p>At M&aacute;l&aacute;d in the Th&aacute;na District, the worship of
ancestors is performed on the day of the father&rsquo;s death every
month till the completion of one year by inviting Br&aacute;hmans and
giving them a feast. This is done among Br&aacute;hmans only. The other
communities worship their ancestors by performing the rite called
<i>Chata Shr&aacute;ddha</i> and by giving <i>Shidha</i>,
<i>i.e.</i><span class="corr" title="Not in source">,</span>
rice<span class="corr" title="Not in source">,</span> pulse, vegetables
and ghi to Br&aacute;hman priests. A feast is then given to their
castemen.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e4905src" href="#xd27e4905" name=
"xd27e4905src">22</a></p>
<p>At Kolh&aacute;pur, ancestors, <i>Mahants</i> and
<i>S&aacute;dhus</i> are worshipped by the rites known as the Puranic
ritual, that is, no Vedic <i>mantras</i> are repeated while performing
these rites. It is a common belief in this province that the soul of
the person who has committed a murder, or has incurred debt and enmity,
is obliged to repay the debt by being born again as a servant or in
some other subordinate capacity of the debtor.<a class="noteref" id=

<i>Sakh&aacute;r&aacute;m B&aacute;va</i> of Kawad. A man suffering
from fits showed an inclination to go to Kawad to read <i>Guru

accordingly. After his arrival, he continued to suffer from these fits
in the morning and evening at the time of the worship at the tomb. Once
during the fits he said that he would be free from the disease if Rs.
200 were spent in giving a feast to the Br&aacute;hmans at P&aacute;li.
The relatives of the sufferer agreed to arrange accordingly, and
instantly the man put his head on the <i>Sam&aacute;dhi</i> (tomb) and
threw himself on his back. He came to his senses after ten minutes, and
from that time he was completely cured. A feast was then given to the
Br&aacute;hmans at P&aacute;li, and Rs. 200 were spent over it as
promised. Another instance of miracular power is cited, and that is of
the priest of the goddess <i>Mahaluxmi</i> of Kolwan. This priest goes
up and hoists the flag of the goddess on a steep hill which no other
person can climb, and it is believed that he can do this only when the

<p>In the Kolh&aacute;pur District people believe that the
<i>Sam&aacute;dhi</i> of Sw&aacute;mi Anandm&uacute;rti, who was a
disciple of Raghunath Sw&aacute;mi of Bhraman&aacute;l, shakes on the
<i>Shiwar&aacute;tri</i> day, that is the 13th of the dark half of
<i>M&aacute;gha</i>, and on the R&aacute;manawami day <i>i.e.</i> the
9th of the bright half of <i>Chaitra</i>, at the time of the worship
called <i>Bhajan</i>. Among the tombs held most sacred by the Hindus of
the Konkan may be mentioned the following <i>viz<span class="corr"
title="Not in source">.</span></i>: Bhujang Sw&aacute;mi of Lokapur,
R&aacute;md&aacute;s Sw&aacute;mi, the <i>Sam&aacute;dhi</i> of Shri
Shankar&aacute;ch&aacute;rya at Shirgaon, Chintaman Sw&aacute;mi of
Murgud, and the <i>Sam&aacute;dhi</i> of Mangalm&uacute;rti Morya at
Chinchwad near Poona. All these <i>Sw&aacute;mis</i> were
<i>Brahmach&aacute;ris</i> or bachelors, and they spent their lives in
the service of God and preached virtue and morality to the masses.
These <i>Sam&aacute;dhis</i> are of two kinds: (1) of saints after
death, and (2) of saints on the point of death. The third kind is
called <i>Jal Sam&aacute;dhi</i>, <i>i.e.</i><span class="corr" title=
"Not in source">,</span> immersion in water, but no tomb of the latter
kind is to be found in this Province. It is said that, if a lime is
placed above the <i>Sam&aacute;dhi</i> of Bhujanga Sw&aacute;mi, it
begins to shake at the time of the <i>Arti</i> ceremony. The present
disciple of Bhujanga Sw&aacute;mi sits in (<i>Sam&aacute;dhi</i>)
meditation continuously for four to eight days. There prevails a belief
at Kolh&aacute;pur that the <i>sw&aacute;mi</i> whose body is buried in
the tomb at Chinchwad is still alive. Some years ago when the present
disciple of the Chinchwad <i>Sw&aacute;mi</i> was anxious to take
<i>Sam&aacute;dh</i>, he had a dream in which the <i>sw&aacute;mi</i>
in the tomb told him that he was still living in that
<i>Sam&aacute;dhi</i>, and that therefore there was no need for his
disciple to take <i>Sam&aacute;dh</i>. He was thus obliged to forego
the project. The Peshwas of Poona, who were staunch devotees of the
Chinchwad <i>sw&aacute;mi</i>, and by whose favour they were raised to
a position of social equality among the Deccan Br&aacute;hmans, granted
an <i>Inam</i> of some villages for the maintenance of this
<i>Sam&aacute;dhi</i>, and the British Government have allowed the
descendants of the <i>sw&aacute;mi</i> to retain the <i>Inam</i>. The
following are the principal Musalman saints who have been deified in
the Kolhapur District:&mdash;</p>
<p>(1) <i>B&aacute;ba Jam&aacute;l</i>, (2) <i>Ghod Pir</i>, (3)
<i>Bara Im&aacute;m</i>, (4) <i>Avachit Pir</i>, (5) <i>Buran
S&aacute;heb</i> and (5) <i>Mira S&aacute;heb</i> of <i>Miraj</i>. All
these Pirs have been supplied with annual grants of money by the
Kolh&aacute;pur State.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e5171src" href=

<p>At Ubh&aacute;d&aacute;nda in the Vengurla taluka of the
Ratn&aacute;giri District some Hindus have adopted the worship of
Mahomedan saints. Mahomedan Pirs are worshipped in the month of
<i>Moharram</i>. On these occasions Hindus beg in the town in the
disguise of <i>Fakirs</i>, and the alms thus obtained are offered to
the Pir. They make offerings of water to the Pirs, while the
<i>t&aacute;buts</i> are being carried to the sea for immersion. But
this practice is being slowly discontinued.<a class="noteref" id=

<p>At Poladpur in the Mah&aacute;d taluka of the Kol&aacute;ba District
there are no instances of Musalm&aacute;n saints being worshipped by

Hindus. They make vows to the Pirs in order to get a son, and when
their object is fulfilled they offer a preparation of <i>Til</i>
(sesamum) and sugar called <i>Rewadi</i>, and other sweets called
<i>Chonge</i>, <i>Malinda</i> and <i>Pedhe</i> at the time of
<i>Moharram</i>. They also give <i>Fakiri</i> to their sons in the

very loudly the words &lsquo;<i>Yalli Dhulla</i>&rsquo;. The holiday of
the <i>Moharram</i> is observed for ten days. On the tenth day the
<i>t&aacute;buts</i> and the <i>N&aacute;lpirs</i> are taken

returning home from the river with the bundle of the <i>Patka</i> of

<p class="first">At Ubh&aacute;d&aacute;nda in the Ratn&aacute;giri
District the following dreams are believed to be lucky and propitious.
To swim through the river or sea, to rise to the sky, to see the Sun,
the Moon and the other planets, to eat meat, to bathe in blood, and to
eat rice and curds. It is also believed that the sight of white objects
in dreams foretells success in any work or undertaking that may be in
view. A deity, a Br&aacute;hman, a king, a married woman decked with
ornaments, a bullock, a mountain, trees full of fruits, climbing the
<i>Umber</i> tree, a looking glass, meat and flowers, if seen in
dreams, are good omens. Climbing the <i>Palas</i> tree,
<i>Warul</i><span class="corr" title="Not in source">,</span>
<i>i.e.</i><span class="corr" title="Not in source">,</span> an ant
heap, the bitter lime tree, to marry, to use red clothes or red flower
garlands, to eat cooked meat, to see the sun and the moon without
lustre, and to see shooting stars during dreams, are said to be bad
omens.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e5720src" href="#xd27e5720" name=

the Ratn&aacute;giri District dreams are believed to be caused by
indigestion and restlessness. To embrace a dead body in a dream, to see
troubled waters, to dine heartily, are said to be bad omens. Feasting
friends and receiving gifts from them are said to be good
omens.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e5728src" href="#xd27e5728" name=

<p>At <span class="corr" title="Source: Fonde">Fonda</span> in the

elephant, and a deity are considered inauspicious.<a class="noteref"

<p>At Pendur in the Ratn&aacute;giri District it is believed that
dreams foretell future events. It is believed that the dream will prove
correct and effective if the person dreaming has asked three questions
and received three answers in his dream. Those dreams which are caused
through cold are called <i>Jalap</i>. They are generally false dreams,
and no good omens are derived therefrom.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e5761src" href="#xd27e5761" name="xd27e5761src">5</a></p>
<p>At Basani in the Ratn&aacute;giri District it is believed that the
ancestors who take interest in the welfare of their descendants appear
in dreams and foretell future events, so that the dreaming person may
take the needful precautions for the prevention of future
calamities.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e5766src" href="#xd27e5766" name=

of the Ratn&aacute;giri District it is believed that dreams in the last
part of the night, <i>i.e.</i>, just before daybreak, and in which
great men are seen, generally prove effective. If anybody sees himself
married in a dream it is supposed that he will hear of the death of
some relative.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e5777src" href="#xd27e5777"
name="xd27e5777src">7</a></p>
<p>At Chauk in the Kol&aacute;ba District it is believed that, when
calamities are threatened, the guardian deity of the family as well as
the dead ancestors appear in dreams and give warnings of the coming
calamities.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e5785src" href="#xd27e5785" name=

<p>The people of Poladpur in the Kol&aacute;ba District believe in
dreams; and when some of their deities appear in dreams and give them
advice or directions, they are careful to follow them. Sometimes even
evil spirits appear in dreams, and advise the people to do certain
things to avert calamities. People who have faith in such spirits act
according to their wishes, and if they fail to do so, trouble is sure
to follow.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e5791src" href="#xd27e5791" name=
"xd27e5791src">9</a></p>
<p>The people of Khopoli in the Kol&aacute;ba District believe that if
a person sees in a dream, the dead body of a near relative, it
indicates that the person whose corpse was seen in the dream will live
long.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e5797src" href="#xd27e5797" name=
"xd27e5797src">10</a></p>
<p>At Birwadi in the Kol&aacute;ba District it is believed that if a
person sees a snake in a dream, a son will be born to him; if he sees a
hell, he is sure to get wealth. If he sees gold, it is a sure sign of
losing wealth. Again, if a person sees himself taking his meals in a
dream, it indicates that his death is nigh at hand.<a class="noteref"

<p>At M&aacute;l&aacute;d in the Th&aacute;na District, omens are
derived from dreams. In case of bad dreams the god Vishnu is
remembered, and the gods Shankar and M&aacute;ruti are also
worshipped.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e5807src" href="#xd27e5807" name=
"xd27e5807src">12</a></p>
<p>At Bel&aacute;pur, wood, cowdung cakes and turbid water, if seen in
dreams, foretell calamities. White clothes, beautiful flowers, and food
containing sweetmeat are considered auspicious.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e5812src" href="#xd27e5812" name="xd27e5812src">13</a></p>
<p>At Murb&aacute;d in the Th&aacute;na District it is believed that
all black things, and white things such as ashes, are inauspicious when
seen in dreams, but a black cow, white flowers, and pearls are
auspicious. Considering the four parts of the night, the dreams that
occur in the first part prove effective within one year, that of the
second part within six months, that of the third within three months,
and of the fourth within one month, and those caused at daybreak are
realized immediately.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e5817src" href=
"#xd27e5817" name="xd27e5817src">14</a></p>
<p>At Kolh&aacute;pur, dreams are believed to be caused through some
mental derangement or bodily disorder. It is customary to derive omens
from dreams, but their nature greatly depends upon the different times
at which these dreams occur. The dreams caused in the latter part of
the night, <i>i.e.</i> just before daybreak, are believed to come
true.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e5825src" href="#xd27e5825" name=

<p>At Ubh&aacute;d&aacute;nda in the Vengurla taluka it is believed
that the soul of a person leaves the body temporarily during his sleep;
hence it is said that no changes or marks of colour, etc. should be
made on the body of a person during sleep, because it is believed that,
while returning, the soul identifies the body, and if it is satisfied
with the marks of the body it enters it; otherwise it might not
return.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e5832src" href="#xd27e5832" name=
"xd27e5832src">16</a></p>
<p>At Adivare it is believed that only Hindu saints and ascetics, after
deep and devout meditation, are capable of removing the soul from the
body. It is believed that their souls go to heaven during that period
and return at pleasure. At present there are no such s&aacute;dhus in
the district.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e5837src" href="#xd27e5837"
name="xd27e5837src">17</a></p>
<p>Many Hindus in the Ratn&aacute;giri District believe that the soul
goes to drink water at night, and therefore keep a pot filled with
water at their sleeping place.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e5842src"
href="#xd27e5842" name="xd27e5842src">18</a></p>
<p>The people of Chaul in the Kol&aacute;ba District do not consider it
possible ordinarily for the soul to leave the body, but they state that
the Sw&aacute;mi of Alandi, who died in or about the year 1886, used to
remove his soul from the body by means of <i>Yoga</i>.<a class=

<p>At Kolh&aacute;pur, it is believed that the soul leaves the body
temporarily at night when a person is asleep.<a class="noteref" id=

<p>At Bankavali in the D&aacute;poli taluka, it is believed that ghosts
or evil spirits have the form of a human being, but their feet are
turned backwards. They can assume any form they choose. Their character
is ordinarily to trouble the people, but when satisfied they are said
to prove friendly. The following story is narrated of a person who went
to reside in one of the villages of the Konkan. His wife was first
attacked by a ghost called Girha. The Girha troubled him much by
playing mischief in his house, <i>viz<span class="corr" title=
"Not in source">.</span></i>: by taking away eatables or by mixing dirt
in his food. At night he used to divest the couple of their clothes,
and on one occasion an ornament was removed by the spirit from the
person of the wife. Tired of these annoyances, the man left the village
and went to reside at a distance, when, to the astonishment of the
public, it happened that the ornament which was lost at the old village
was restored to the man&rsquo;s wife while she was asleep in the new
village, and nobody knew who brought it there. All this was believed to
be the work of the Girha.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e5870src" href=
"#xd27e5870" name="xd27e5870src">21</a></p>
<p>At Ubh&aacute;d&aacute;nda in the Vengurla taluka people believe
that a <i>Bhut</i> is fierce in aspect and very troublesome, but when
its wishes are complied with, it becomes harmless. The <i>Bhuts</i>
reside in jungles, burial or cremation grounds, old trees, sacred
groves and deserted houses. They assume all sorts of shapes and forms.
Sometimes they appear very tall, and they can instantly assume the
shape of a dog, a cat, a tiger, or any other animal. Some ghosts are
even seen fishing on the banks of rivers.<a class="noteref" id=

<p>At <span class="corr" title=
"Source: Mitb&aacute;v">Mithb&aacute;v</span> in the Devgad taluka it
is believed that the souls of those who die with their wishes
unfulfilled take the form of a <i>Bhut</i>. They enter the bodies of
people. Any woman who is attacked by the <i>Bhut</i> of a Pir becomes
able to speak in the Hindi language although it may not be her mother
tongue. When a child or a person is suffering from the attacks of a
spirit, incense is burnt, and it at once begins to tell the whereabouts
of the spirit and the reason why the person has been attacked. He is
then asked to state what he wants, and when the things which the spirit
wants are offered, it goes away.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e5895src"
href="#xd27e5895" name="xd27e5895src">23</a> Spirits are generally
invisible.</p>
<p>The spirits that belong to the class of malignant <i>Bhuts</i> are
of a ferocious appearance; but those that belong to the class of
friendly <i>Bhuts</i> possess bodies like human beings.<a class=

<p>At N&aacute;ringre in the Devgad taluka, it is believed that spirits
are cruel by nature and have no shadow, that they are capable of taking
any form they like, and can perform miracles.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e5917src" href="#xd27e5917" name="xd27e5917src">25</a> At Pendur
it is believed that <i>Bhuts</i> eat chillies, and that they do not
speak with human beings. Spirits are said to remove and conceal their
victims for a certain period of time.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e5923src" href="#xd27e5923" name="xd27e5923src">26</a> At
Vijayadurg, a <i>Bhut</i> is considered to be of mean character. People
perform certain rites to bring it under subjection. Their actions are
always contrary to nature. When a person begins to cry, dance, to eat
forbidden things etc. he is said to be attacked by a <i>Bhut</i>. When
there is enmity between two persons, the one who dies first becomes a
<i>sambandh</i> and troubles his living enemy.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e5936src" href="#xd27e5936" name="xd27e5936src">27</a> At Basani,
there is a belief that there are two kinds of spirits. Some aim at the
welfare of the people, and others are always troublesome. As they have
no regular form they cannot easily be recognised. They can change their
forms at any time.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e5939src" href=
"#xd27e5939" name="xd27e5939src">28</a></p>
<p>The character of a <i>Bhut</i> is to trouble people and to take
revenge on an old enemy. A person attacked by a spirit speaks
incoherently and acts like a mad man. In such cases the leaves of the
herb <i>sat&aacute;p</i> are used. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb52"
href="#pb52" name="pb52">52</a>]</span>The leaves are pounded and put
under the patient&rsquo;s nose. In a few minutes, the person who is
possessed by the spirit begins to speak.<a class="noteref" id=

<p>The people of Chauk in the Kol&aacute;ba District believe that the
main function of a <i>Bhut</i> is to frighten people, to beat them, and
to make them perform unpleasant tasks and thereby to obtain food from
them.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e5960src" href="#xd27e5960" name=

href="#xd27e5966" name="xd27e5966src">31</a> The people of Akshi

sometimes those of an evil spirit.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e5985src"
href="#xd27e5985" name="xd27e5985src">34</a></p>
<p>In the Kolh&aacute;pur District, it is believed that the character
of a <i>Bhut</i> is like that of a human being. When a person is
attacked by a spirit, a great change is observed in his language and
actions. He begins to speak in the language of the <i>Bhut</i> by which
he is attacked. If the ghost is of the female sex, the person speaks
the language of females. It is believed that the souls of those who
have been murdered or tortured assume the form of a spirit known as
<i>Sambandh</i>, and trouble the murderer or the torturer, by entering
his body. It is said that in some cases the spirit does not leave the
body of such a person till he dies, thus exacting revenge for his past
misdeeds.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e5999src" href="#xd27e5999" name=
"xd27e5999src">35</a> In Khopoli in Ratn&aacute;giri it is said that
the cow which is given to a Br&aacute;hman while performing the funeral
rites of a dead person helps him to reach heaven. He gets there by
catching hold of her tail. There are three paths to the other world.
They are <i>Bhaktim&aacute;rga</i>, <i>Karmam&aacute;rga</i>, and
<i>Yogam&aacute;rga</i>. The <i>Karmam&aacute;rga</i> is believed to be
superior to all.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e6015src" href="#xd27e6015"
name="xd27e6015src">36</a> At M&aacute;l&aacute;d, a belief prevails
that the path to the other world is through the Him&aacute;layas. While
going through the mountains of the Him&aacute;layas, souls find
happiness or sorrow according to their actions in life-time. The people
also believe that the soul returns every month on the date of the
man&rsquo;s death to accept <i>K&aacute;gv&aacute;s</i><span class=

"Source: Dahigaum">Dahigaon</span> in the Murb&aacute;d taluka, it is
customary among the Hindus to smear with cow dung the place from which
a dead body has been removed to the burning ground. The place is then
covered with rice flour, and is hidden under a basket, an oil-lamp
being kept, burning near by. The persons who accompany the corpse
return home to look at the lamp, and it is believed that the soul of
the deceased will pass to any creature or species of which footprints
are seen on the rice flour.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e6038src" href=

<p>At Kolh&aacute;pur it is believed that the soul of a person after
death attains that state to which he aspires at the last moment before
his death. Virtuous persons who die without any desire reach heaven and
remain there in the form of the stars, where they are believed to enjoy
the happiness of heaven. Some of them are sent to this world when they
wish to return. Sinners are said to reach hell in consequence of their
misdeeds, but some remain in this world in the form of
<i>Bhuts</i>.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e6046src" href="#xd27e6046"

<p>At R&aacute;i in the S&aacute;lsette taluka it is believed that the

those committing suicide take the form of a ghost, and those who die on
battlefields attain eternal salvation.<a class="noteref" id=

<p>The people of Ubh&aacute;d&aacute;nda in the Vengurla taluka believe

<p>In the Konkan, people attempt to find good or bad omens in sneezing.
It depends upon the time and the position or standing of the person who
sneezes. If a sick person sneezes it is presumed that he will recover
from his illness within a very short period, but if the sneezing is
caused by the use of tobacco or snuff, no good or bad omens are
drawn.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e6132src" href="#xd27e6132" name=

<p>In the Konkan it is believed that sneezing and yawning indicate the
call of death, and therefore it is customary among the Hindus to snap
the thumb and the middle finger at the time of yawning, and to repeat

<p>At Kolh&aacute;pur, people believe that sneezing and yawning
forebode evil, and the practice is to repeat the following words at the
time of sneezing and yawning, viz, <i>Shatanjiva</i> <i>i.e.</i> Live a

snapping the thumb and finger (<i>chutaki</i>). In the case of a person
suffering from a serious illness, sneezing is supposed to indicate a
cure. If a woman sneezes while a man speaks, it is lucky, and if a man
sneezes it is unlucky. The reverse is the case in respect of
females.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e6184src" href="#xd27e6184" name=

water and a twig of the <i>nim</i> tree in the entrance of the house,
and all persons entering the house have to wash their feet with this
water.</p>
<p>A knife or some other sharp weapon is kept under the bed of the
woman in order that the mother and her child may not be attacked by a
spirit.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e6765src" href="#xd27e6765" name=
"xd27e6765src">120</a></p>
<p>The chief reason for ensuring the correct moment for the birth is
that, if the birth takes place at an unlucky hour, special rites are
necessary for averting the evil effects. These rites consist in the
recitation of certain holy <i>mantras</i> and in giving presents of
money, sessamum, <i>j&aacute;gri</i>, clarified butter, etc., to the
Br&aacute;hmans and alms to the poor.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e6776src" href="#xd27e6776" name="xd27e6776src">121</a></p>
<p>At Medhe in the Rohe taluka, it is customary for the father to throw
a stone in a well, a pond, or a river at the birth of his son, and then
to look at the face of the child.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e6781src"
href="#xd27e6781" name="xd27e6781src">122</a></p>
<p>An owl is considered to be a bird of such evil repute that, in all
parts of the Konkan, it is considered necessary to perform expiatory
rites when an owl perches on the roof. If these rites are not
performed, it is firmly believed that some evil will befall the members
of the family. Various omens are drawn from the cries of the bird
<i>Pingla</i>, and these cries are known as <i>Kilbil</i>,
<i>Chilbil</i> and <i>Khit Khit</i>.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e6798src" href="#xd27e6798" name="xd27e6798src">123</a></p>
<p>If an owl sits on the roof of a house, it is a sure sign of coming
death to a member of the family.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e6803src"
href="#xd27e6803" name="xd27e6803src">124</a></p>
<p>At Devgad in the Ratn&aacute;giri District the sound of a bat or an
owl is considered inauspicious, and indicates the death of a sick
person in the house.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e6808src" href=
"#xd27e6808" name="xd27e6808src">125</a></p>
<p>At Chauk an owl is said to have some connection with spirits. Its
sound at night indicates the approaching death of a sick person in the
house. One variety of the owl called the <i>pingla</i> is supposed to
foretell future events by its movements and cries, while the bat is
considered an inauspicious bird, and its appearance forebodes coming
evil.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e6816src" href="#xd27e6816" name=
"xd27e6816src">126</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb59" href="#pb59"
name="pb59">59</a>]</span></p>
<p>At Umbergaon people do not throw stones at an owl. For it is
considered that the owl might sit and rub the stone, and that the
person throwing it will become weak and wasted as the stone wears
away.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e6822src" href="#xd27e6822" name=
"xd27e6822src">127</a></p>
<p>The people of Kolh&aacute;pur do not believe that there is any
connection between the bat or owl and the spirits of the dead, but they
believe that, if an owl cries out in the evening or at night, it
indicates the death of a sick person in the family. This applies also
to the sound of a single <i>pingla</i>, but the sound of a pair of
<i>pinglas</i> is considered auspicious.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e6833src" href="#xd27e6833" name="xd27e6833src">128</a></p>
<p>It is generally believed that old unoccupied houses are haunted by
evil spirits. Persons who wish to inhabit such houses first perform the
<i>V&aacute;stu sh&aacute;nti</i> ceremony, and give a feast to
Br&aacute;hmans. In former times, in the districts that were ruled by
the Portuguese, religious persecution prevailed. To escape from these
persecutions, people were compelled to leave their houses unprotected.
Before leaving their houses, they used to bury their treasure in the
ground, and on that spot a human being or an animal was sacrificed in
order that the spirit of the dead should hover about the place, and
prevent strangers from coming.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e6841src"
href="#xd27e6841" name="xd27e6841src">129</a></p>
<p>The evil spirits which haunt ruins and guard buried treasures and
old forts are known as <i>Mah&aacute;purush</i>, <i>Khavis</i>,
<i>Brahma R&aacute;kshasa</i> and <i>Sambandh</i>.<a class="noteref"
id="xd27e6858src" href="#xd27e6858" name="xd27e6858src">130</a></p>
<p>If there be any buried treasure in an old unoccupied house, the
owner of the treasure remains there in the form of a ghost. If the
treasure be near the temple of a deity, it is supposed to be under the
guardianship of that deity.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e6864src" href=
"#xd27e6864" name="xd27e6864src">131</a></p>
<p>At Vijayadurg it is believed that a person who builds a house in the
days of his prosperity and does not survive to enjoy it, becomes a
<i>Sambandh</i>. He remains in that house in the form of a ghost, and
troubles every one who comes to stay there, excepting the members of
his family. A man who buries his treasure underground becomes a ghost
after death, comes back to watch his treasure, and troubles those who
try to remove it.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e6872src" href="#xd27e6872"
name="xd27e6872src">132</a></p>
<p>Unoccupied houses are generally haunted by evil spirits. At certain
forts in the Konkan where battles were fought, the souls of those slain
in the battles are said to have assumed the forms of spirits, and to
keep a watch over the forts.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e6880src" href=
"#xd27e6880" name="xd27e6880src">133</a></p>
<p>In the Kolh&aacute;pur District there is a village Nigve beyond the
river Panch Ganga at a distance of three miles from Kolh&aacute;pur,
where the soul of a person named App&aacute;ji Kulkarni has assumed the
form of a <i>Sambandh</i> and guards the buried treasures in his house.
When anybody tries to dig up the buried money, the ghost enters the
body of his daughter-in-law and begins to dance and cry out loudly, and
does not allow any one to touch his treasure. It is also said that he
strikes the ground with his stick at night. Another similar instance is
cited in the case of the village of Latvade in the Shirol Peta, where
B&aacute;pujipant Kulkarni continues to guard his house after death. He
does not allow anybody to live in the house, and if any one is bold
enough to sleep there at night, the spirit of B&aacute;puji appears and
throws him out of the house. The house is therefore uninhabited at
present. His wife has adopted a son, but he has to live in another
village<span class="corr" title="Not in source">,</span>

<h2 class="label">CHAPTER VI.</h2>
<h2 class="main"><i>THE EVIL EYE AND THE SCARING OF GHOSTS.</i></h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Hindus generally believe in the effects of the evil
eye. If an accident befall any thing of value, or it undergoes any
sudden change, it is said to be due to the effects of an evil eye. In
order to escape from the influence of an evil eye, people begin the use
of incantations and charms on a Sunday, Wednesday, or Thursday and
finish them on the third or the fifth day. Small children, domestic
animals, and beautiful objects are generally liable to be affected by
an evil eye.</p>
<p>The following are some of the methods of evading the effects of an
evil eye.</p>
<p><i>1st.</i>&mdash;Dry chillies are waved round the body of the
affected person and thrown into the fire, and if they do not thereupon
make a loud noise, it is said that the effects of an evil eye are
averted.</p>
<p><i>2nd.</i>&mdash;Mustard seed and salt are waved round the face of
a child and then thrown into the fire.</p>
<p><i>3rd.</i>&mdash;Alum is waved round the child and then thrown into
fire. The piece of alum thus thrown is sometimes believed to be changed
into the form of a man or a woman. From this, conjectures are made as
to the sex of the person by whose evil eye the patient is affected. The
form or the figure is then broken by a toe of the left foot of the
patient, and dry chillies, garlic, hair, rubbish from the house and
salt are mixed in the alum powder. The mixture is waved round the
patient three times and then thrown into fire. Meanwhile the sorcerer
repeats the names of all persons, things and evil spirits suspected by
him. After this performance has been repeated three times, the fire is
deposited in a public place where three roads meet.</p>
<p><i>4th.</i>&mdash;If the evil eye is believed to be that of a ghost,
the sorcerer mutters some words to himself, waves ashes round the
affected child, and blows them in the air.</p>
<p><i>5th.</i>&mdash;The evil eye of a tiger is removed from an
affected animal in the following manner. An oil lamp is burnt in the
eye of a dead tiger and the lamp is waved round the animal by a
Mah&aacute;r. The Mah&aacute;r is given a loaf prepared from eight
kinds of grain.</p>
<p><i>6th.</i>&mdash;Copper amulets and black cotton strings charmed by
a sorcerer are also tied round the neck or arms of the
patient.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e6929src" href="#xd27e6929" name=
"xd27e6929src">1</a></p>
<p>When a child is to be removed from one village to another, rice is
scattered at the boundary of the village, at the bridges, rivers,
creeks, etc, that are crossed during the journey. Cocoanuts are waved
round the child and thrown away at the boundary of the village and at
places supposed to be haunted by ghosts. Before entering a house in a
new village, a small quantity of boiled rice, bread, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb61" href="#pb61" name="pb61">61</a>]</span>or
grains of rice are waved round the child and thrown away. It is
believed that, when black ointment is applied to the eyes, cheeks, or
forehead of a child, there is no fear of its being affected by an evil
eye. This also depends on the position of the stars at the birth of a
child. If anybody sees a beautiful thing and praises it, there is a
chance of its being affected by an evil eye. It is believed that
children, animals, trees, and even wood and stones, are apt to be
affected by an evil eye. In order to avoid injury from an evil eye,
cocoanut shells or a shoe are tied on a conspicuous part of a tree or a
creeping plant, black beads known as <i>Vajrabuttu</i> are tied round
the necks of children, and <i>cowries</i> and black beads are tied
round the necks of animals. Even grown up persons are affected by an
evil eye. When a man is very ill or frequently becomes unconscious,
cocoanuts, fowls and boiled rice are waved round him and thrown
away.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e6942src" href="#xd27e6942" name=
"xd27e6942src">2</a></p>
<p>When the effects of an evil eye cannot be removed by ordinary
methods, the evil influence is said to have entered through the bones,
&lsquo;<i>H&aacute;di drusta padali</i>.&rsquo; In order to remove it
people bring the bone of an animal in the evening, and after besmearing
it with oil and turmeric powder, wash it in hot water. It is dressed in
a yellow cloth, and black and red ointments are applied to it. It is
then waved round the affected person, and thrown away in some public
place where three roads meet.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e6954src" href=
"#xd27e6954" name="xd27e6954src">3</a></p>
<p>For evading the effects of an evil eye, salt, mustard seed, hair,
garlic, dry leaves of onions, dry chillies, and seven small stones from
the road are put on the fire. The fire is then waved round the body of
the affected person and thrown away. Charmed black cotton strings are
turned over the burning incense and tied round the arm or the neck.
Charmed ashes from the temples of certain deities are also applied to
the forehead of the affected person.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e6959src" href="#xd27e6959" name="xd27e6959src">4</a></p>
<p>At <span class="corr" id="xd27e6964" title=
"Source: Ibhr&aacute;mpur">Ibr&aacute;mpur</span> in the
Ratn&aacute;giri District, it is believed that a person whose eyes have
come under the influence of evil stars possesses the power of the evil
eye. Ashes are taken on a mango leaf, and charmed with the
<i>mantras</i> or incantations for an evil eye, and then they are
applied to the forehead of the affected person.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e6970src" href="#xd27e6970" name="xd27e6970src">5</a></p>
<p>The people of Poladpur in the Kol&aacute;ba District believe the
effects of an evil eye to be as follows. A healthy child becomes sickly
and cries, a man may suffer from indigestion or loss of appetite, a cow
or a she-buffalo yielding plenty of milk suddenly ceases to give milk
or gives blood in place of it, a good image is disfigured or broken,
and even stones are shattered to pieces by the effects of an evil
eye.</p>
<p>The following devices are used to ward off such evil effects. A
black mark is made on the forehead of children. Black beads called
<i>Drustamani</i>, and <i>Vajrabuttu</i> are tied round their necks.
Marking nuts and cowries tied with a black thread are fastened round
the necks of animals. A little black spot is marked on an image. A worn
out shoe or a sandal is tied to the fruit-yielding trees. Salt and
mustard seed are waved thrice round the face of a child repeating
&ldquo;<i>Ishta mishta kony&aacute; p&aacute;pinichi drushta</i>&rdquo;
and thrown into the fire. Some people roll a cotton thread round a
curry stone, wave it three times round the patient, and then put it
into the fire; if the thread burns, the evil eye is held to have been
removed. If the evil eye be on the food, three morsels of food are
first raised to the mouth, and then thrown into the fire. Sacred ashes
are applied to trees and creeping plants to remove the effects of an
evil eye.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e6989src" href="#xd27e6989" name=
"xd27e6989src">6</a></p>
<p>The people of Khopoli in the Kol&aacute;ba District believe that the
evil eye can be diverted from living creatures only, and not from
inanimate things such as a stone or an earthen image. Sacred ashes are
applied to the forehead of the suffering child by <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb62" href="#pb62" name=
"pb62">62</a>]</span>repeating the <i>R&aacute;m raksha stotra</i>,
<i>i.e<span class="corr" title="Not in source">.</span></i>, the
protecting praises of R&aacute;ma, the seventh incarnation of Vishnu.
Among Br&aacute;hmans, rice grains are waved thrice round the face of a
child and put into water. The water is then thrown away. Even flowers
are waved round the faces of small children in the evening and thrown
away.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e7004src" href="#xd27e7004" name=
"xd27e7004src">7</a></p>
<p>At Chauk in the Karjat taluka of the Kol&aacute;ba District, some
people wave the left shoe thrice round the body of the affected person
for the purpose of evading the effects of an evil eye. A red hot iron
bar is also cooled in water mixed with turmeric powder.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e7009src" href="#xd27e7009" name=
"xd27e7009src">8</a></p>
<p>At Shirg&aacute;on in the M&aacute;him taluka of the Th&aacute;na
District water is drawn in a brass or a copper pot in the evening, and
turmeric powder, rice, and any other edible articles on which the evil
eye has fallen are put into it. Twentyone date leaves, each of them
with a knot, are then waved round the body of the affected person and
thrown into the water pot, burning coals being dropped into the
mixture. The pot is then waved thrice round the body of the affected
person, and kept in a corner of the bedroom for one night, with a
basket, a broom, and a sandal or an old shoe placed on the top. It is
then thrown away in the morning in some public place where three roads
meet. If the water becomes red, it is supposed that the evil eye has
been removed.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e7014src" href="#xd27e7014"
name="xd27e7014src">9</a></p>
<p>The effects of an evil eye are sometimes visible on the face of a
child in the form of small red pustules. The appearance of such
pustules is called <i>Ch&aacute;k padane</i>.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e7022src" href="#xd27e7022" name="xd27e7022src">10</a></p>
<p>If a person is affected by an evil eye at the time of taking his
meals, he loses his appetite. He also becomes weaker day by day. One of
the modes of removing these evils is to wave fresh date leaves three
times round the face of the affected person, and to throw them into
water. Some people take water in a copper plate and extinguish in it
burning sticks of the tamarind tree, after waving them round the body
of the affected person.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e7027src" href=
"#xd27e7027" name="xd27e7027src">11</a></p>
<p>At Kh&aacute;rb&aacute;v in the Bassein taluka of the Th&aacute;na
District, five pieces of broken tiles are made red hot and put into
water in which a little quantity of all the cooked food in the house
has been mixed. Turmeric powder is also put into it. A pen knife or
some other iron instrument is then turned five times in the water. A
winnowing basket and a broom are waved thrice round the face of the
affected person, and placed over the water pot.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e7032src" href="#xd27e7032" name="xd27e7032src">12</a></p>
<p>At Dah&aacute;nu in the Th&aacute;na District, two big stones, of
which one has been waved round the face of a person affected by an evil
eye, are struck one against the other. If the stone breaks, it is
believed that the evil effect has been removed. Cowdung is mixed with
water in a brass or a copper plate, and dust from a public road, hair,
and burning black cotton cloth are put into another small vessel. This
vessel is then waved round the person, and placed upside down over the
mixture of cowdung. If it sticks to the brass plate, this is supposed
to be due to the evil eye.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e7038src" href=
"#xd27e7038" name="xd27e7038src">13</a></p>
<p>The people of Kolh&aacute;pur believe in the effects of an evil eye.
A child suffering from an evil eye turns pale and thin, and suffers
from headache. To avoid these effects, elderly women make a mark with
lamp black on the face or brow of the child. Boiled rice and curds, and
bread and oil are also passed round the face of a child, and thrown
into a public road.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e7049src" href=
"#xd27e7049" name="xd27e7049src">14</a></p>
<p>Generally, in the Konkan districts, opprobrious names are given to
children when they are sickly, always crying, and weak, or when they
are short lived. These names are <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb63"
href="#pb63" name="pb63">63</a>]</span><i>Marya</i>, <i>Rodya</i>,
<i>Kerya</i>, etc. It is believed that children improve in health when
called by such opprobrious names.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e7067src"
href="#xd27e7067" name="xd27e7067src">15</a></p>
<p>Opprobrious names such as <i>Dhondu</i>, <i>Kondu</i>, <i>Keru</i>,
are given to children in families in which the first children are
shortlived. But their real names are different. The names of the
wellknown arithmetician Keru N&aacute;na Chhatre and his son Kondopant
Chhatre are examples of opprobrious names.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e7084src" href="#xd27e7084" name="xd27e7084src">16</a></p>
<p>Among high class Hindus, the first son is not generally called by
his real name, but by one of the opprobrious names given
above.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e7089src" href="#xd27e7089" name=
"xd27e7089src">17</a></p>
<p>Children are sometimes weighed with shoes or sandals, and also with
cowdung. In some cases, their nostrils are bored, especially the right
one.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e7094src" href="#xd27e7094" name=
"xd27e7094src">18</a></p>
<p>Hindus generally call their children by the names of their deities
and ancestors, and they attribute the premature death of their children
to their own misbehaviour towards such ancestors, or to their having
abused them; they fear that such abuse or misbehaviour has offended the
ancestors. To avoid their displeasure and the consequent death of their
children, the people give opprobrious names to their next born such as
<i>Dagadya</i>, <i>Dhondya</i>, <i>Gundya</i>,
<i>Dandya</i><span class="corr" title="Not in source">,</span>
<i>Kerya</i>, <i>Ukirdya</i>, <i>Kondya</i>, <i>Lobhya</i>, etc. The
custom of tattooing one side of the body of females also prevails in
the Kolh&aacute;pur District, especially in cases where the children in
a family are shortlived.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e7126src" href=
"#xd27e7126" name="xd27e7126src">19</a></p>
<p>In the <i>Pur&aacute;nas</i> there are instances of males being
transformed into females, and females into males. For example, the
female Amba was transformed into a male called Shikhandi and the male
N&aacute;rad was transformed into a female. Arjuna, the third brother
of the P&aacute;ndavas is said to have changed his sex, and turned into
Bruhannada.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e7134src" href="#xd27e7134" name=
"xd27e7134src">20</a></p>
<p>In the <i>Shivlilamruta</i>, a book pertaining to the god Shiva, in
the chapter of Simantini, it has been described how a man was turned
into a woman.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e7145src" href="#xd27e7145"
name="xd27e7145src">21</a></p>
<p>At Kolh&aacute;pur, there are no instances known of a change of sex.
The goddess Yallamma has a high reputation in this district for making
a change in the habits and deportments of men and women, especially
among low caste people. It is believed that the curse of this goddess
has the power of destroying the virility of males, whereupon they
behave like females. Many instances of this type can be seen at the
fair of the goddess Yallamma, which is held in
<i>M&aacute;rgashirsha</i> (December); men dressed in women&rsquo;s
clothes and vice versa are often seen at this fair.<a class="noteref"
id="xd27e7153src" href="#xd27e7153" name="xd27e7153src">22</a></p>
<p>In Western India, iron nails are generally used when any spirit is
to be buried in the ground. Other metals, such as gold, silver, and
copper, are sometimes offered to the ghosts. The blood of fowls and
goats is also offered to them. When incense is burnt before a sorcerer,
the spirit enters into his body. Water is charmed and sprinkled over
the body of a person attacked by an evil spirit. Rice and <i>udid</i>
grains are required for exorcising spirits. Red powder <i>Pinjar</i>,
turmeric powder, black ointment <i>k&aacute;jal</i>, lemons, <i>Narakya
Wuda</i> a kind of incense, betel-leaves, betelnuts, cocoanuts, mango
leaves, <i>Nirgu&#7693;i</i> leaves, and pieces of cloth are also used
for the same purpose.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e7174src" href=
"#xd27e7174" name="xd27e7174src">23</a></p>
<p>Cane sticks are used by people as a protection against evil spirits.
A stick cut from the tree known as <i>P&aacute;ndhri</i> is also used
as protection. Charmed black cotton strings are tied to the wrist, arm
or neck. If a man is very much afraid of a ghost, he repeats the name
of the monkey god M&aacute;ruti or any other deity that may be
favourable to his family.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e7183src" href=

<p>The blood of fowls and goats is used as a protection against ghosts
and <i>Devach&aacute;rs</i>, and also against witchcraft. Charmed water
is waved round the person affected by an evil spirit, and thrown away.
Rings, amulets, and anklets made of metals of five kinds are put on the
hands and legs of children to ward off the effects of evil
spirits.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e7195src" href="#xd27e7195" name=
"xd27e7195src">25</a></p>
<p>It is customary among certain people to apply spittle to the
sandalpaste mark on the forehead of a man, and to the red <i>Kunku</i>
mark on the forehead of an unwidowed woman. It is considered to be a
protection against evil spirits.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e7206src"
href="#xd27e7206" name="xd27e7206src">26</a></p>
<p>The beak of an eagle, a stick cut from a tree known as
<i>P&aacute;ndhri</i>, a cane having three joints, and the root of a
shrub called <i>Shr&aacute;vad</i>, which has white leaves, are used as
protection against evil spirits.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e7217src"
href="#xd27e7217" name="xd27e7217src">27</a></p>
<p>At Pendur in the M&aacute;lwan taluka of the Ratn&aacute;giri
District it is believed that an iron stick held in the hand is a
protection against evil spirits.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e7225src"
href="#xd27e7225" name="xd27e7225src">28</a></p>
<p>At Chauk in the Karjat taluka of the Kol&aacute;ba District,
pictures of certain deities are tattooed on the body for the purpose of
protection against evil spirits. It is also believed that evil spirits
run away when salt and garlic are thrown into fire as they cannot bear
the smoke of burning garlic.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e7230src" href=
"#xd27e7230" name="xd27e7230src">29</a></p>
<p>At Medhe in the Rohe taluka, when the dead body of a woman dying
within ten days of her delivery is taken out of the house for burial,

<p>Iron nails and horseshoes are driven into the threshold or on to the
door of a house on the full moon day or the last day of the Hindu
calendar month at evening time, to prevent the entrance of evil
spirits. Dirty localities being considered to be haunts of evil
spirits, people living in such localities burn incense in their houses
every day. While exorcising evil spirits the sorcerers throw charmed
<i>Udid</i> grains and <i>R&aacute;le</i> panic seeds on the body of
the diseased, or place these things below <i>his</i> bed. Rings made of
metals of five kinds,&mdash;iron, copper, brass, silver and
gold&mdash;are charmed on an eclipse day, and worn by people. Red lead
and cowries are tied to the necks or feet of animals as protection
against evil spirits. The spirits that haunt buried treasures are
pacified by the blood of fowls and goats when digging up such
treasures.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e7262src" href="#xd27e7262" name=

<p>Certain <i>mantras</i> are written on a paper, and the paper is tied
to a black cotton string, or the paper is put into a copper amulet, and
then tied to a black cotton string. The black cotton string with the
amulet is then tied round the arm or the neck of a person attacked by
evil spirits, or suffering from malarial fevers. These <i>mantras</i>
are never disclosed to anybody.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e7273src"

<p><i>N&aacute;d&aacute;dora</i> is a black cotton thread having seven
or nine knots with a charmed paper in one of these knots. The thread is
first held over burning incense, and then tied round the neck or the
arm of the diseased. Sunday is generally chosen for attaching these
threads.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e7281src" href="#xd27e7281" name=

<p>At Poladpur in the Kol&aacute;ba District, there lived a sorcerer
who used to give such amulets and charmed threads. He placed about ten
or twelve copper rings or amulets in a copper plate kept in the sun.
While thus exposed to the sun, these amulets were continuously watched
by the sorcerer for some two hours, repeating certain
<i>mantras</i>.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e7293src" href="#xd27e7293"

<p>At M&aacute;l&aacute;d in the Th&aacute;na District, copper amulets
and charmed black cotton threads in the name of K&aacute;l Bhairav, an
incarnation of the god Shiva, are used as protective against evil
spirits. They are tied to the arms or the neck of the diseased on an
eclipse day, on the last day of the Hindu calendar month, or on a
Tuesday, Wednesday and Saturday.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e7298src"

<p>At Kolh&aacute;pur, the use of amulets is generally resorted to by
people suffering from the attacks of evil spirits or from malarial
fevers. The sorcerer who exorcises the evil spirits writes certain
<i>mantras</i> on a paper, or draws certain symbols and repeats the
<i>mantras</i> over them. The paper is then wrapped in an amulet made
of copper or silver, and fastened to a cotton thread. This amulet is
tied round the arm or the neck of the diseased. Before tying it to the
arm or the neck, it is once held over burning incense.<a class=

<p>A sacred circle is frequently used as a protection from spirits. The
sorcerer draws a circle on the ground, with his stick, and the
following articles are put inside it. Cocoanuts, lemons, red lead, and
a <i>Kohala</i> gourd. Fowls are also sacrificed to this circle. The
filling in of this circle is called <i>m&aacute;nda bharane</i> by the
exorcists.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e7322src" href="#xd27e7322" name=

<p>Rice or <i>Udid</i> grain, and ashes charmed by <i>mantras</i>, are
scattered round a certain area of land, or are given to a person
supposed to be affected by evil spirits. The spirits cannot enter a
place charmed in this manner. They are also scattered round the place
supposed to be haunted by evil spirits in the belief that neither evil
spirits nor snakes can transgress the boundary thus marked by a
sorcerer.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e7333src" href="#xd27e7333" name=

<p>Formerly sages and saints used to make such sacred circles round
their residence, repeating certain <i>mantras</i>, for their protection
from evil spirits. It is believed that the spirits cannot enter or
leave these enchanted circles. They used to bury bottles containing
such spirits at the boundaries of these circles. There are many such
places in the Kolh&aacute;pur District, such as
Bur&aacute;ns&aacute;heb of Brahmapuri, the S&aacute;dhubuwa of

<p>Among the Hindus in Western India, for the purpose of helping the
spirit to go to heaven safely, and for securing its goodwill towards
the survivors, after death ceremonies called the
<i>Shr&aacute;ddhas</i> are generally performed. Some perform these
ceremonies once a year in the month of <i>Bh&aacute;drapada</i>, and
others perform them twice or thrice<span class="corr" title=
"Not in source">,</span> <i>i.e.</i><span class="corr" title=
"Not in source">,</span> on the anniversary day of the deceased as well
as in the dark half of <i>Bh&aacute;drapada</i>, which is generally
known as the <i>manes&rsquo;</i> fortnight (<i>pitru
paksha</i>).<a class="noteref" id="xd27e7483src" href="#xd27e7483"
name="xd27e7483src">59</a></p>
<p>The funeral solemnities performed from the 1st to the 14th day from
the death of the deceased are as described below:&mdash;</p>
<p>On the first day, at the time of burning the dead body, a plot of
ground is purified by repeating certain <i>mantras</i>, and the corpse
is then placed on it. Before setting the funeral pile on fire, balls of
boiled rice or wheat flour are put on the face, the forehead, arms and
the chest of the corpse. Such balls are placed <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb67" href="#pb67" name="pb67">67</a>]</span>on the
body of the deceased only when death has taken place on an unlucky day,
or when there is an unlucky conjunction of stars. The son, or some
other near relative, of the deceased generally performs these rites
with the help of a Br&aacute;hman priest. On the third day he goes to
the burning place, collects the ashes of the deceased, and throws them
into the sea. On this occasion he is accompanied by the relatives of
the deceased. Rich persons who are able to go to Benares keep the bones
of their deceased parents and throw them into the Ganges at
Pray&aacute;ga near Benares after performing certain
<i>Shr&aacute;ddhas</i> there. The giving of oblations continues daily
till the tenth day. The oblations of the tenth day are called <i>Das
Pinda</i>. The rites of the eleventh day are called <i>Ekotistha</i>.
On the eleventh day the person performing the rites has to change his
sacred thread, after sipping a little cow&rsquo;s urine. Cooked food is
prepared at the place where the rites of the eleventh day are
performed, and Br&aacute;hmans are fed there, or at least thirty-two
mouthfuls of cooked food are offered to the sacred fire. A big ball of
boiled rice is put before the sacred fire or near the Br&aacute;hmans
taking their meals. This ball is then thrown into the sea. A male calf
is branded, worshipped and let loose. This calf is called <i>Vasu</i>,
and is considered sacred by the villagers. On the 11th day, special
ceremonies for propitiating the eight <i>Vasus</i> and the eleven
<i>Rudras</i> are performed, and gifts of a plot of ground, a cow,
cooking vessels, various kinds of corn, golden images, silver and
copper coins, clothes, shoes, umbrellas, bedding, etc. are given to the
Br&aacute;hmans collected there. On the 13th day after death a feast is
given to 13 or more Br&aacute;hmans and the other relatives.
<i>Navak&aacute;d&aacute;n</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, the gift of a ship and
<i>Goprad&aacute;n</i><span class="corr" title="Not in source">,</span>
<i>i.e.</i>, of a cow and a calf, are also given to the Br&aacute;hmans
on the understanding that they will help the soul of the dead while
crossing the river Vaitarna.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e7529src" href=
"#xd27e7529" name="xd27e7529src">60</a></p>
<p>Water mixed with <i>til</i> or sesamum seed, sandalpaste, and
oblations of boiled rice are given daily to the <i>manes</i> to secure
their goodwill towards the survivors.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e7540src" href="#xd27e7540" name="xd27e7540src">61</a></p>
<p>At Bankavli in the D&aacute;poli taluka of the Ratn&aacute;giri
District, in order to prevent the soul from assuming the form of a
ghost, there is a custom of tying a piece of <i>Gulvel</i>, a species
of moonseed, or the seed of a vegetable known as
<i>M&aacute;thbh&aacute;ji</i>, round the neck of the corpse before
burning it. It is also believed that, by doing this, the soul is
prevented from troubling the survivors.<a class="noteref" id=

<p>At Poladpur in the Kol&aacute;ba District, some villagers drive an
iron nail into the head of the corpse before it is taken to the funeral
ground. They believe that, in consequence, the soul of the deceased
will not turn into an evil spirit. Some people scatter grain on the
road while the corpse is being carried to the cremation
ground.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e7556src" href="#xd27e7556" name=

<p>Among the Hindus in the Konkan, as well as in the Deccan, dead
bodies are generally burnt, but under the following circumstances they
are buried.</p>
<p>Persons dying of small pox, women dying in childbirth or during
their menses, children dying within six months from their birth, and
<i>Sany&aacute;sis</i> are buried. The bodies of persons suffering from
leprosy are necessarily buried.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e7566src"
href="#xd27e7566" name="xd27e7566src">64</a> Among Ling&aacute;yats the
bodies are always buried. Certain <i>mantras</i> are repeated while
burying or burning the dead body. While burying, cocoanuts and certain
kinds of grain are thrown into the grave, and after covering the dead
body with salt, the grave is filled up with earth and stones.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e7572src" href="#xd27e7572" name=
"xd27e7572src">65</a> While burning, the dead body is placed on the
funeral pile with its head to the north and feet towards the south.
<i>Tulsi</i> wood, sandal-wood, and <i>Bel</i> wood are kept on the
pile before placing <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb68" href="#pb68"
name="pb68">68</a>]</span>the dead body over it. Cocoanuts and camphor
cakes are placed on the body, and it is set on fire. Among the
Ling&aacute;yats and Gos&aacute;vis the dead are buried. Before
burying, the Ling&aacute;yats have to take a written order from their
priest, the Ayya or Jangam. The paper is then tied to the neck of the
deceased, and the body is placed in a bag made of new cloth, the head
being allowed to remain out of the bag. <i>Bhasma</i> or ashes, salt
and camphor are also put into the bag along with the corpse, which is
then buried. The Jangam repeats <i>mantras</i> when the body is in the
grave. No such written order is necessary for the burial of
Gos&aacute;vis. A cocoanut is broken on the head of the corpse at the
time of burying it. Among high class Hindus the corpse is carried to
the funeral ground in a bier made of bamboos. Among the
Ling&aacute;yats a gaily dressed frame called <i>Makhar</i> is prepared
on the bier, and the body is dressed with clothes and head dress and
seated in the <i>Makhar</i>. Some of them carry the dead body in a bag
made of blanket. There is a custom of keeping foot-prints on the spot
where a <i>Sany&aacute;si</i> is buried, and they are daily worshipped
by the people.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e7603src" href="#xd27e7603"

<p>Among high class Hindus boiled rice is daily offered to the dead
after a portion has been thrown into the fire, the remainder being
given to the crows. The portion thrown in the fire is called
<i>Vaishvadev</i>, and that which is given to the crows is called
<i>K&aacute;gw&aacute;s</i>. Among other Hindus it is given on the last

A ball of boiled rice and a little quantity of water or milk is kept

which can be purified by washing are washed and taken back, while
things like <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb69" href="#pb69" name=

boiling water to bathe the corpse is broken when the body is carried to

after the son has passed thrice round the pile with an earthen vessel
filled with water. It is believed that birds and animals drinking water
out of these vessels would be infected by disease, and this is the
reason why these pots are broken. The mourners who use earthen vessels

<p>All the members of the family of the dead have to observe mourning
for ten days. They are purified on the eleventh day after taking a bath
and sipping <i>Panchgavya</i>, or the five products of the cow. The son
of the dead person, or one who performs the funeral rites of the dead
is purified on the twelfth day after completing the rites of
<i>Sapindi</i>. A man in mourning does not touch those who are not in
mourning. If anybody touches him, both of them have to take a bath. The
son of the deceased or, in the absence of a son, any male member
belonging to the family is entitled to perform the funeral rites of the
dead. These rites are performed during the first twelve days, beginning
from the first day or from the 3rd, 5th, 7th or the 9th. One who
performs these rites has to sleep on the ground during these twelve
days. A person hearing of the death of a member of his family within
the first ten days from the date of the death, becomes free from that
mourning on the eleventh day. If he happens to hear it within one month

ground, and has to take his meals only once a day till the end of the
13th day. He takes his bath in cold water. Sweet things are not
prepared in the house during the days of mourning. During the period of
mourning, every morning, a Br&aacute;hman comes to the mourner&rsquo;s
house and recites some passages from the <i>Garud Pur&aacute;na</i>,
which relates to the state of the soul after death. On the eleventh day
the house is besmeared with cowdung, and cow&rsquo;s urine is sprinkled
in the house. All the clothes are washed. Mourning is not observed in
the case of a death of a <i>Sany&aacute;si</i>, and the
Ling&aacute;yats do not observe any kind of mourning.<a class="noteref"

three or one day only.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e7707src" href=

taken out to visit the temple of any deity by the people assembled

<p>At Kolh&aacute;pur it is believed that the deities Etal&aacute;i and
K&aacute;lk&aacute;i of the Konkan districts keep with them evil
spirits as their servants. These servant spirits obey the orders of
these deities. Some people in this district go to the temples of these
deities and request them to lend them the services of these spirit
servants. It is considered very lucky to secure the help of these
spirits. The temple ministrant then requests the deity to give a
<i>Kaul</i> or omen. For this purpose, the temple ministrant calls on
the deity to enter his body, and when he is possessed by the spirit of
the deity, he allows the applicant to take with him one of the
deity&rsquo;s servants for a fixed period. The Gurav, or the
ministrant, then explains to the person the period for which the spirit
servant is given, and the amount of the annual tribute required to be
given to the deity for the use of her servant. He also gives him a
cocoanut and sacred ashes. The applicant then returns home, believing
that the spirit servant will follow him, and from that time he
prospers. This spirit servant is called <i>Chetuk</i>, and it can be
seen only by the person in whose charge it is given by the
Gurav.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e7731src" href="#xd27e7731" name=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Groves of mango trees are considered to be sacred as
they have a pleasing appearance, and afford grateful shelter against
the heat of the day. It is a general belief among Hindus that trees
from which such pleasure and protection are derived must naturally be
the abode of the gods. There are many such groves in Sat&aacute;ra.
During the spring season people go to these groves and worship the
trees. The Hindus have a general prejudice against cutting living trees
which yield fruits, and it is considered specially inauspicious to cut
the following trees:&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Umbar</i>, <i>Vad</i> or Banian tree, <i>Pipal</i>,
<i>Saundad</i> or <i>Shami</i>, <i>Palus</i>, <i>Bel</i>, <i>Rui</i>,
<i>Avali</i> and the <i>Tulsi</i> plant, for it is believed that these
trees are the abode of deities, <i>e.g.</i> the god Datt&aacute;traya
resides under the <i>Umbar</i> tree, the goddess P&aacute;rvati on the
Banian tree, and the god Vishnu resides near the <i>Tulsi</i> plant.
The god Brahma, the creator of the world, is found in the <i>Pipal</i>
tree. The plantain tree is also considered to be sacred. While
gathering a bunch of plantains, the tree is first cut before the bunch.
It is considered inauspicious to gather the bunch without so
doing.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e7889src" href="#xd27e7889" name=
"xd27e7889src">1</a></p>
<p>There are certain groves at Ubh&aacute;d&aacute;nda in the Vengurla
taluka of the Ratn&aacute;giri District which are supposed to be
haunted by <i>Devach&aacute;rs</i>, and are therefore not cut by the
people.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e7897src" href="#xd27e7897" name=
"xd27e7897src">2</a></p>
<p>The people of <span class="corr" id="xd27e7902" title=
"Source: Ibhr&aacute;mpur">Ibr&aacute;mpur</span> in the Chiplun taluka
consider it inauspicious to cut the <i>Vad</i> and <i>Pipal</i> trees
of which the thread ceremonies have been performed. After the thread
ceremony of these trees is over, a stone platform is raised around
them.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e7911src" href="#xd27e7911" name=
"xd27e7911src">3</a></p>
<p>At <span class="corr" title="Source: Fonde">Fonda</span> in the
Devgad taluka, it is considered inauspicious to cut the trees and the
groves that surround the temple of a village deity, for they are
believed to belong to that deity.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e7922src"
href="#xd27e7922" name="xd27e7922src">4</a></p>
<p>At Padghe in the Th&aacute;na District, the trees which are supposed
to have been haunted by evil spirits such as <i>Sambandh</i>,
<i>Munja</i>, <i>Devach&aacute;r</i>, etc. are not generally cut by the
people through fear of these spirits. When any tree is cut down, the
custom is to keep a stone at the root of the tree in order that the
place may no longer be affected or haunted by the spirit in the
tree.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e7939src" href="#xd27e7939" name=
"xd27e7939src">5</a> There are certain families who do not burn
<i>Pipal</i>, <i>Khair</i>, or <i>Shiwani</i> wood. They believe that
the burning of these trees causes harm to their families. It is said
that the burning of the <i>Apta</i> tree causes the breeding of the
insect known as <i>Gochadi</i>, <i>i.e.</i><span class="corr" title=

<p>There is an <i>Awdumbar</i> tree of the god Datt&aacute;traya at
Bhillawadi, and a big Banian tree near the <i>math</i> of the
Ling&aacute;yat <i>sw&aacute;mi</i> named Kadappa near Kolh&aacute;pur,
which are worshipped by the people of the neighbouring villages. The
<i>Saundad</i> tree, better known as <i>Shami</i>, is worshipped once a
year on the <i>Dasara</i>, the 10th day of the bright half of
<i><span class="corr" id="xd27e7989" title=
"Source: Ashwin">Ashvin</span></i> (October). It is said that
R&aacute;ma, the seventh incarnation of Vishnu, kept his arms on the
<i>Shami</i> tree during his fourteen years&rsquo; exile, and took them
back again when he marched upon Lanka or Ceylon to kill R&aacute;wan,
the demon king of Ceylon. While going to Lanka he bowed to the
<i>Shami</i> tree, and as he was successful in his undertaking, the
Mar&aacute;th&aacute;s used to start for a campaign on the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb72" href="#pb72" name=
"pb72">72</a>]</span><i>Dasara</i> day after worshipping the
<i>Shami</i> tree, and distributing its leaves among their friends
calling it <i>Suwarn</i> or gold. This is said to be the origin of the
festival of <i>Dasara</i>. A species of the tamarind tree called
<i>Gorakh Chinch</i> is said to be connected with the Hindu saint
Gorakhn&aacute;th. For this reason this tree is worshipped by the
people. A great fair is held every year at Battis Shir&aacute;le in the
Sat&aacute;ra District, which is situated at a distance of about ten
miles from Kolh&aacute;pur.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e8015src" href=
"#xd27e8015" name="xd27e8015src">7</a></p>
<p>The <i>Pipal</i>, the <i>Umbar</i>, the <i>Vad</i> or Banian tree,
and the <i>Tulsi</i> plant are worshipped by Hindus in general. The
<i>Apta</i> tree is worshipped by Hindus on the <i>Dasara</i> day, and
its leaves are distributed under the name of <i>sone</i>, or gold,
among their friends and relatives.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e8042src"
href="#xd27e8042" name="xd27e8042src">8</a></p>
<p>At Medhe in the Roha taluka of the Kol&aacute;ba District, there is
a tree <i>Vehala</i> (Beleric myrobalan) which is believed to be
connected with the local deity Mhasoba. It is considered to be a sacred
tree, and nobody dares to cut it or to touch it with the feet.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e8053src" href="#xd27e8053" name=
"xd27e8053src">9</a></p>
<p>At Shirg&aacute;on in the M&aacute;him taluka of the Th&aacute;na
District there is a <i>R&aacute;njani</i> tree on the bank of a tank
called Khamb&aacute;le, which is said to be connected with the deity
Brahma; and therefore no branch of that tree is cut by the people. It
is considered harmful to cut the tree.<a class="noteref" id=

<p>At <span class="corr" id="xd27e8067" title=

Kolh&aacute;pur District, there is a <i>Vad</i> tree connected with the
saint Kabir. It is called <i>Kabirvad</i>. There is also an

known as <i>Datt&aacute;traya Awdumbar</i>.<a class="noteref" id=

<p>The <i>Umbar</i>, <i>Pipal</i>, <i>Vad</i>, and the <i>Tulsi</i>
plant are considered to be sacred, and are respected by Hindus. The
following are some of the legends about their sacredness.</p>
<p><i>Umbar</i>&mdash;When the god Vishnu in his fourth incarnation,
called Narsinh, <i>i.e.</i><span class="corr" title=
"Not in source">,</span> half man and half lion, tore into pieces the
body of the demon named Hiranyakashipu with his claws, he felt a
burning sensation of the poison from the body of that demon, which was
assuaged by thrusting his hands into the trunk of the <i>Umbar</i> or

<p>In order that they may get the auspicious sight of a deity early in
the morning, Hindus generally plant the <i>Umbar</i> and <i>Tulsi</i>
trees in front of their houses, and worship them daily. The juice of
the root of the <i>Umbar</i> has a cooling effect, and hence it is
freely used in cases of measles or itch. Its sap is also used as
medicine for swellings. It is very pleasant to sit under the shade of
this tree, and as it is believed that the god Datt&aacute;traya resides
beneath this tree, it is held very sacred by the Hindus.<a class=

<p><i>Pipal</i>&mdash;The <i>Pipal</i> tree is considered very sacred
because it is believed that the god Brahma resides in the roots, the
god Vishnu in the trunk, and the god Shiva on the top of this tree.
Persons who make a particular vow or have any objects to be fulfilled
worship the <i>Pipal</i> tree, and walk round it several times every
day.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e8149src" href="#xd27e8149" name=
"xd27e8149src">14</a> The evil spirits <i>Sambandh</i>,
<i>Devach&aacute;r</i>, <i>Munja</i>, and <i>Vet&aacute;l</i> haunt the
<i>Pipal</i> tree. These spirits are considered to be the servants of
the god Shiva. It is also believed that persons who worship and walk
round this tree daily are not affected by those spirits. The
<i>Pipal</i> tree is specially worshipped at dawn on Saturday as it is
considered that the gods Brahma, Vishnu, and Mahesh or Shiva happen to
be there at that time.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e8171src" href=

<p><i>Vad</i> or the Banian tree&mdash;A prince named Satyaw&aacute;n
died of snakebite under the <i>Vad</i> tree. His wife named
S&aacute;vitri, who was very chaste and dutiful, requested Yama, the
god of death, and succeeded in securing from him the life of her
husband Satyaw&aacute;n. As the prince Satyaw&aacute;n returned from
the jaws of death under the <i>Vad</i> tree, this tree was specially
worshipped by her, and it is therefore believed that S&aacute;vitri has
ever since then been responsible for the practice of worshipping the
<i>Vad</i> tree by women for the purpose of securing a long life to
their husbands.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e8188src" href="#xd27e8188"
name="xd27e8188src">16</a> It is also believed that the god Vishnu
takes shelter under the <i>Vad</i> at the time of the general
destruction of the world. The worship of this tree is similar to that
of the other deities, and women take turns around it at the close of
the worship or <i>puja</i>.<a class="noteref" id="n79.2src" href=
"#n79.2" name="n79.2src">17</a></p>
<p>The <i>Tulsi</i> plant is worshipped daily by the Hindus in general,
and women in particular, by keeping the plant near their houses. The
god Vishnu is worshipped particularly by the leaf of this
plant.<a class="pseudonoteref" href="#n79.2">17</a> The <i>Tulsi</i>
plant is considered by the people to represent the goddess Luxmi, the
wife of Vishnu. Hindu women will not take their meals before
worshipping the <i>Tulsi</i> plant daily in the morning. It is also
said that the god Vishnu, in his eighth incarnation called Krishna, had
loved Vrunda, the wife of a demon. After her death she was burnt, but
on her burning ground there grew the <i>Tulsi</i> plant. As Krishna
loved Vrunda very dearly, he began to love this plant also, and hence
the image of B&aacute;l Krishna, or the god Vishnu, is married to this
plant every year on the 12th day of the bright half of
<i>K&aacute;rtik</i> (November).<a class="noteref" id="xd27e8225src"
href="#xd27e8225" name="xd27e8225src">18</a> As it is also believed
that the god Vishnu resides in the <i>Tulsi</i> plant, the worship of

<p>Besides the above mentioned trees, the <i>Palus</i> (Butea
frondosa), the <i>Bel</i>, a tree sacred to god Shiva, and the
<i>Shami</i> (Prosopis spicigera), a tree sacred to god Ganpati the son
of Shiva, are considered to be holy by the Hindus.<a class="noteref"

<p>A common custom among Hindus is for a person who has lost his two
wives and wishes to marry a third, to be first married to a <i>Rui</i>
plant, and then to the actual bride. His marriage with the <i>Rui</i>
plant is considered as a third marriage. After the marriage, the
<i>Rui</i> plant is cut down and buried, and thus the marriage with the
third bride is considered to be a fourth marriage. The marriage with
the <i>Rui</i> plant has been adopted in the belief that the third wife
is sure to die unless the spirit of the deceased is made to enter the
<i>Rui</i> plant.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e8266src" href="#xd27e8266"

<p>When a girl is born under the influence of inauspicious planets
which may be harmful to her husband, she is first married to a tree or
an earthen pot, and then to the bridegroom. The marriage with the
earthen pot is called <i>Kumbhaviv&aacute;ha</i>, or the pot-wedding.
It is believed that, by observing this practice, the danger to her
husband is avoided. The danger passes to the tree to which she is first
married.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e8277src" href="#xd27e8277" name=

unable to marry owing to his poverty is first married to a <i>Rui</i>
plant and then to a widow. This marriage with a widow is called
<i>p&aacute;t l&aacute;vane</i>. This remarriage of a widow among the
lower classes is generally performed at night, and under an old mango
tree. It is never performed in the house. A widow who has remarried
cannot take part in any auspicious ceremony such as a marriage,
etc.<a class="pseudonoteref" href="#n79.8">23</a></p>
<p>At Vankavli in the Ratn&aacute;giri <span class="corr" id=

<p>Persons who have no children make a vow to Khandoba at Jejuri that
the firstborn, male or female, shall be offered to him. The females,
offered in fulfilment of such vows are called <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb74" href="#pb74" name=
"pb74">74</a>]</span><i>Muralis</i>. They are married to the god
Khandoba, and have to earn their livelihood by begging in villages. A
male child thus offered to the god is called a
<i>V&aacute;ghya</i>.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e8315src" href=
"#xd27e8315" name="xd27e8315src">25</a></p>
<p>There is a custom of offering children to the deities Yallamma and
Khandoba in fulfilment of vows made in order to get a child. The child
is taken to the temple of these deities, accompanied with music. The
temple ministrant asks the child to stand on a wooden board on a heap
of rice in front of the deity, and puts into its hands a
<i>paradi</i>&mdash;a flat basket of bamboo, tying to its neck the
<i>darshana</i> of the deity. A female child is married to the
dagger&mdash;<i>Katy&aacute;r</i>&mdash;of the deity. When once this
ceremony has been performed, parents abandon their rights to such
children. When these children come of age, the males can marry but the
females cannot. The latter earns her livelihood begging <i>jogava</i>
in the name of the goddess Amba with a <i>paradi</i> in her hand. A
male child offered to the goddess Yallamma is called <i>jogata</i>, and
a female, <i>jogatin</i>. Children dedicated to the goddess
M&aacute;y&aacute;ka are called <i>Jogi</i> and <i>Jogin</i>. Children
offered to <i>Firang&aacute;i</i> and <i>Amb&aacute;b&aacute;i</i> are
called <i>Bhutya</i> (male) and <i>Bhutin</i> (female).<a class=

<p>In the Konkan districts there is a class of women known as
Bh&aacute;vinis who are said to be married to <i>Khanjir</i>,
<i>i.e.</i>, a dagger belonging to the god. They are also called
<i>deva yoshita</i><span class="corr" id="xd27e8374" title=
"Source: .">,</span> <i>i.e.</i>, prostitutes offered to the god. They
have no caste of their own. They retain the name of the caste to which
they originally belonged, such as Mar&aacute;the Bh&aacute;vini,
Bhand&aacute;ri Bh&aacute;vini, Sut&aacute;r <span class="corr" id=
"xd27e8380" title="Source: Bhavini">Bh&aacute;vini</span>, etc. The
following account is given of the origin of the sect of
Bh&aacute;vinis. A woman wishing to abandon her husband goes to the
temple of a village deity at night, and in presence of the people
assembled in that temple she takes oil from the lamp burning in the
temple, and pours it upon her head. This process is called <i>Deval
righ&#772;ane</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, to enter into the service of the
temple. After she has poured sweet oil from the lamp upon her head, she
has no further connection with her husband. She becomes the maid
servant of the temple, and is free to behave as she likes. Daughters of
such Bh&aacute;vinis who do not wish to marry, undergo the process of
<i>shesa bharane</i>, and follow the occupation of their mothers. The
sons of the Bh&aacute;vinis have an equal right to the property of
their mother, but any daughter who marries a lawful husband loses her
share in the property of her mother. A Devali follows the occupation of
blowing the horn or cornet, and is entitled to hold the torches in the
marriage ceremonies of the people in the village. Many of them learn
the art of playing upon the tabour&mdash;<i>mrudunga</i>&mdash;and are
useful to <i>Kathekaris</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, those who recite legends of
the gods with music and singing. Some of them become farmers while
others are unoccupied.</p>
<p>Bh&aacute;vinis follow the occupation of a maid-servant in the
temple, but their real occupation is that of public women. They are not
scorned by the public. On the contrary, they are required to be present
at the time of a marriage to tie the
marriage-string&mdash;<i>Mangalsutra</i>&mdash;of a bride, for they are
supposed to enjoy perpetual unwidowhood&mdash;&lsquo;<i>Janma
suw&aacute;sini</i>.&rsquo; Some of the houses of Bh&aacute;vinis
become the favourite resorts of gamblers and vagabonds. In the absence
of a daughter, a Bh&aacute;vini purchases a girl from a harlot, and
adopts her as her daughter to carry on her profession.<a class=

<p>Snakes are believed to be the step-brothers of the gods. They reside
under the earth and are very powerful. The snake is considered to be
very beautiful among creeping animals, and is one of the ornaments of
the god Shiva. An image of a snake made of brass is kept in the temple
of the god Shiva, and worshipped daily along with the god. There is a
custom among the Hindus of worshipping <i>N&aacute;ga</i>, <i>i.e.</i>,
the cobra, once a year on the <i>N&aacute;ga panchami</i> day,
<i>i.e.</i>, the fifth day of the bright half of <i>Shr&aacute;wan</i>
(August). Images of snakes are drawn with sandalpaste on a wooden board
or on the walls of houses, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb75" href=
"#pb75" name="pb75">75</a>]</span>and worshipped by Hindu women on this
day. <i>Durva</i> grass, sacred to Ganpati, parched rice
<i>l&aacute;hya</i>, legumes <i>kadadan</i>, and milk are offered to
this image. Some people go to the <span class="corr" id="xd27e8442"
title="Source: snakes,">snake&rsquo;s</span> abode
<i>V&aacute;rul</i>&mdash;an ant-hill&mdash;on this day to worship the
snake itself, if they happen to catch sight of it.<a class="noteref"
id="xd27e8449src" href="#xd27e8449" name="xd27e8449src">28</a></p>
<p>It is said that at Battisa Shir&aacute;le in the Belg&aacute;um
District the real <i>N&aacute;ga</i> comes out of its abode below the
earth on this day, and is worshipped by the people. Milk and
<i>l&aacute;hya</i>, parched rice, are put outside the house at night
on this day with the intention that they may be consumed by a snake.
Hindus do not dig or plough the earth on <i>N&aacute;ga panchami</i>
day. Even vegetables are not cut and fried on this day by some
people.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e8466src" href="#xd27e8466" name=

<p>Earthen images of snakes are worshipped by some people in the Konkan
districts on the <i>N&aacute;ga panchami</i> day. The
<i>N&aacute;ga</i> is considered to be a Br&aacute;hman by caste, and
it is believed that the family of the person who kills a snake becomes
extinct. The cobra being considered a Br&aacute;hman, its dead body is
adorned with the <i>j&aacute;nawe</i>, and then burnt as that of a
human being. A copper coin is also thrown into its funeral
pile.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e8480src" href="#xd27e8480" name=
"xd27e8480src">30</a></p>
<p>At certain villages in the Deccan a big earthen image of a snake is
consecrated in a public place on the <i>N&aacute;ga panchami</i> day,
and worshipped by Hindus in general. Women sing their songs in circles
before this image while men perform <i>tam&aacute;sh&aacute;s</i> by
its side. In fact, the day is enjoyed by the people as a holiday. The
snake is removed next day, and an idol in the form of a man made of mud
is seated in its place. This idol is called Shir&aacute;lshet, who is
said once to have been a king and to have ruled over this earth for one
and one-fourths of a <i>ghataka</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, for half an hour
only. This day, is observed as a day of rejoicing by the
people.<a class="noteref" id="n81.4src" href="#n81.4" name=

<p>The names of the snake deities are Takshaka, V&aacute;suki and
Shesha. Their shrines are at Kolh&aacute;pur, N&aacute;gothane,
Prayaga, N&aacute;gadev&aacute;chi W&aacute;di and Subramhanya. A great
fair is held every year at Battisa Shir&aacute;le on the <i>N&aacute;ga

<p>There is a shrine of a snake deity at Aw&aacute;s in the
Alib&aacute;g taluka of the Kol&aacute;ba District, where a great fair
is held every year on the 14th day of the bright half of

<p>It is said that a covetous person who acquires great wealth during
his life-time and dies without enjoying it, or without issue, becomes a
snake after death, and guards his buried treasures. At Kolh&aacute;pur
there was a <i>S&aacute;wk&aacute;r</i>&mdash;money-lender&mdash;named
Kodulkar who is said to have become a snake, and to guard his
treasures. In the village of Kailava in the Panh&aacute;la petha of the
Kolh&aacute;pur District there is a snake in the house of a Kulkarni,
who scares away those who try to enter the storehouse of the
Kulkarni.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e8527src" href="#xd27e8527" name=

<p>It is a general belief among the Hindus that snakes guard treasures.
It is said that there are certain places guarded by snakes in Goa
territory. Persons who were compelled to abandon Portuguese territory
owing to religious persecutions at the hands of the Portuguese buried
their treasures beneath the ground. Those who died during exile are
said to have become <i>bhuts</i> or ghosts, and it is believed that
they guard their buried treasures in the form of snakes.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e8535src" href="#xd27e8535" name=
"xd27e8535src">35</a></p>
<p>The Hindus generally believe that the snakes who guard buried
treasures do not allow any one to go near them. The snake frightens
those who try to approach, but when he wishes <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb76" href="#pb76" name="pb76">76</a>]</span>to hand
over the treasure to anybody he goes to that person at night, and tells
him in a dream that the treasure buried at such and such a place
belongs to him, and requests him to take it over. After the person has
taken possession of the treasure as requested, the snake disappears
from the spot.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e8542src" href="#xd27e8542"
name="xd27e8542src">36</a></p>
<p>It is said that a snake which guards treasure is generally very old,
white in complexion, and has long hair on its body.<a class="noteref"

<p>Hindus worship the image of a snake made of <i>Darbha</i> grass or
of silk thread on the <i>Anant Chaturdashi</i> day, <i>i.e.</i>, the
14th day of the bright half of <i><span class="corr" id="xd27e8562"

<p>A snake festival is observed in the N&aacute;geshwar temple at
Aw&aacute;s in the Kol&aacute;ba District on the night of the 14th day
of the bright half of <i>K&aacute;rtika</i> (November). Nearly four
hundred devotees of the god Shankar assemble in the temple, holding in
their hands <i>vetra-sarpa</i> long cane sticks with snake images at
their ends. They advance dancing and repeating certain words, and take
turns round the temple till midnight. After getting the permission of
the chief devotee, they scatter throughout the neighbouring villages
with small axes in their hands, and cut down, and bring from the
gardens, cocoanuts, plantains, and other edible things that are seen on
their way. They return to the temple after two hours, the last man
being the chief devotee called <i>Kuwark&aacute;ndya</i>. The fruits
are then distributed among the people assembled at the temple. Nobody
interferes with them on this day in taking away cocoanuts and other
fruits from the village gardens. On the next day they go dancing in the
same manner to the Kanakeshwar hill with the snake sticks in their
hands.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e8579src" href="#xd27e8579" name=

<p>In the Deccan no special snake festivals like those described above
are celebrated. But in the temples devoted to snake deities, on the
full moon day of <i>K&aacute;rtik</i>, which is sacred to the snake
deity, the deity is worshipped with special pomp, and the crests of the
temples are illuminated on that night.<a class="noteref" id=

<p>The village cures for snakebite are:&mdash;</p>
<p>1. The use of charmed water and the repetition of <i>mantras</i> by
a sorcerer.</p>
<p>2. The use of certain roots and herbs as medicines.</p>
<p>3. The removal of the sufferer to the neighbouring temple.</p>
<p>4. Branding the wound with fire.</p>
<p>5. The drinking of soapnut juice, or of water in which copper coins
have been boiled by the patient, who is thus made to vomit the snake
poison.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e8606src" href="#xd27e8606" name=
"xd27e8606src">41</a></p>
<p>In the Deccan a person suffering from snakebite is taken to a
village temple, and the ministrant is requested to give him holy water.
The deity is also invoked. Thus keeping the person for one night in the
temple, he is carried to his house the following day if cured. The vows
made to the deity for the recovery of the person are then fulfilled.
There is one <i>turabat</i>, a tomb of <i>Avalia</i> a Mahomedan saint,
at Panh&aacute;la where persons suffering from snakebite are made to
sit near the tomb, and it is said that they are cured. In some villages
there are enchanted trees of <i>Kadulimb</i> where persons placed under
the shade of such trees are cured of snakebites. Some people tie a
stone round the neck of the sufferer as soon as he is better, repeating
the words <i>Adi Gudi Im&aacute;m</i> the name of a Mahomedan saint.
After recovery from snakebite the person is taken to the mosque of the
<i>Adi Gudi Im&aacute;m S&aacute;heb</i>, where the stone is untied
before the tomb, and <i>j&aacute;gri</i> equal to the weight of the
stone is offered. A feast is also given to the <i>Muj&aacute;war</i> or
ministrant of the mosque. There is at <span class="corr" id="xd27e8633"
title="Source: persent">present</span> a famous
enchanter&mdash;<i>M&aacute;ntrika</i>&mdash;at Sat&aacute;ra who cures
persons suffering from snakebite. It is said that he throws charmed
water on the body of the sufferer, and in a few minutes the snake
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb77" href="#pb77" name=
"pb77">77</a>]</span>begins to speak through the victim. The sorcerer
enquires what the snake wants. The snake gives reasons for biting the
person. When any thing thus asked for by the snake is offered, the
victim comes to his senses, and is cured. There are many witnesses to
the above fact.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e8641src" href="#xd27e8641"

<p>At <span class="corr" title=
"Source: Mitb&aacute;v">Mithb&aacute;v</span> in the Ratn&aacute;giri
District chickens numbering from twenty to twenty-five are applied to
the wound caused by the snakebite. A chicken has the power of drawing
out the poison from the body through the wound, but this causes the
death of the chicken. The remedy above described is sure to be
successful if it is tried within three hours of the person being
bitten. There are several other medicines which act on the snakebite,
but they must be given very promptly. There are some men in this
village who give charmed water for snake or any other bites. Many
persons suffering from snakebite have been cured by the use of
<i>mantras</i> and charmed water.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e8652src"

<p>Water from the tanks of Vet&aacute;vare in the
S&aacute;vantw&aacute;di State and M&aacute;njare in Goa territory is
generally used as medicine for snakebite. It is believed that by the
power of <i>mantras</i> a snake can be prevented from entering or
leaving a particular area. This process is called &lsquo;<i>sarpa
b&aacute;ndhane</i>&rsquo;. There are some sorcerers who can draw
snakes out of their holes by the use of their <i>mantras</i>, and carry
them away without touching them with their hands.<a class="noteref" id=

<p>A snake is believed to have a white jewel or <i>mani</i> in its
head, and it loses its life when this jewel is removed. This jewel has
the power of drawing out the poison of snakebite. When it is applied to
the wound, it becomes green, but when kept in milk for sometime, it
loses its greenness and reverts to its usual white colour. It gives out
to the milk all the poison that has been absorbed from the wound, and
the milk becomes green. This jewel can be used several times as an

<p>It is believed that an old snake having long hair on its body has a
jewel in its head. This jewel is compared with the colours of a
rainbow. The snake can take this jewel from its head at night, and
search for food in its lustre. Such snakes never come near the
habitation of human beings, but always reside in the depth of the
jungle. This species of snake is called <i>Deva Sarpa</i>, <i>i.e.</i>,
a snake belonging to a deity. It is related that a snake was born of a
woman in the Kinkar&rsquo;s house at Tard&aacute;l in the S&aacute;ngli
State, and another one in the Gabale&rsquo;s house at

<h2 class="label">CHAPTER VIII.</h2>
<h2 class="main"><i>TOTEMISM AND FETISHISM.</i></h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The worship of totems, or <i>Devaks</i>, prevails
among Hindus in Western India. The term <i>Devak</i> is applied to the
deity or deities worshipped at the beginning of a thread or a marriage
ceremony. The ceremony is as follows: A small quantity of rice is put
into a winnowing fan, and with it six small sticks of the <i>Umbar</i>
tree, each covered with mango leaves and cotton thread. These are
worshipped as deities. Near the winnowing fan is kept an earthen or
copper vessel filled with rice, turmeric, red powder, betelnuts, sweet
balls made of wheat flour, ghi and sugar; and on the top of the vessel
is a small sprig of mango and a cocoanut covered with cotton thread.
This vessel is also worshipped as a deity, and offerings of sweet
eatables are made to it. After the worship of this vessel, the regular
ceremony of <i>Puny&aacute;havachana</i> is performed. Twenty-seven
<i>M&aacute;trik&aacute;s</i>, or village and local deities,
represented by betelnuts are consecrated in a new winnowing fan or a
bamboo basket. Seven <i>M&aacute;trik&aacute;s</i> are made of mango
leaves, six of which contain <i>durva</i> grass, and the seventh
<i>darbha</i> grass. Each of them is bound with a raw cotton thread
separately. They are worshipped along with a <i>Kalasha</i> or a copper
<i>lota</i> as mentioned above. This copper <i>lota</i> is filled with
rice, betelnuts, turmeric, etc., a sprig of mango leaves is placed on
the <i>lota</i>, and a cocoanut is put over it. The <i>lota</i> is also
bound with a cotton thread. Sandalpaste, rice, flowers, and
<i>durva</i> grass are required for its worship. An oil lamp called
<i>Arati</i> is waved round the <i>devak</i>, the parents, and the boy
or the girl whose thread or marriage ceremony is to be performed. A
<i>Suw&aacute;sini</i> is called and requested to wave this
<i>Arati</i>, and the silver coin which is put into the <i>Arati</i> by
the parents is taken by her. The father takes the winnowing fan and the
mother takes the <i>Kalasha</i>, and they are carried from the
<i>mandap</i> to the <i>devak</i> consecrated in the house. A lighted
lamp is kept continually burning near this <i>devak</i> till the
completion of the ceremony. After completion of the thread or marriage
ceremony the <i>devak</i> is again worshipped, and the ceremony comes
to an end. The deity in the <i>devak</i> is requested to depart on the
second or the fourth day from the date of its consecration. No mourning
is observed during the period the <i>devak</i> remains installed in the
house.</p>
<p>Among Mar&aacute;th&aacute;s and many of the lower classes in the
Ratn&aacute;giri District the branch of a <i>Vad</i>, <i>Kadamba</i>,
mango, or an <i>Apta</i> tree is worshipped as their <i>devak</i> or
<i>kul</i>.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e8813src" href="#xd27e8813" name=
"xd27e8813src">1</a></p>
<p>Some Mar&aacute;th&aacute;s have a sword or a dagger as their
<i>devak</i>, which is worshipped by them before commencing the ritual
of the marriage ceremony.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e8821src" href=
"#xd27e8821" name="xd27e8821src">2</a></p>
<p>The family known as R&aacute;ne at N&aacute;ringre in the Davagad
taluka of the Ratn&aacute;giri District, and the families known as
Gadakari and J&aacute;dhava at M&aacute;lwan, consider the <i>Vad</i>
or Banian tree as their <i>devak</i>, and do not make use of its
leaves. In the same manner, some people consider the <i>Kadamba</i>
tree sacred to their family.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e8835src" href=
"#xd27e8835" name="xd27e8835src">3</a></p>
<p>There are some people among the Hindus in Western India whose
surnames are derived from the names of animals and plants, such as
<i>Boke</i>, <i>L&aacute;ndage</i>, <i>W&aacute;gh</i>, <i>Dukre</i>,
<i>K&aacute;wale</i>, <i>Garud</i><span class="corr" title=
"Not in source">,</span> <i>More</i>, <i>Mhase</i>, <i>Rede</i>,
<i>Keer</i>, <i>Popat</i>, <i>Ghode</i>, <i>Shel&aacute;r</i>,
<i>G&aacute;yatonde</i>, <i>W&aacute;ghm&aacute;re</i>,
<i>Sh&aacute;lunke</i>, <i>Bhende</i>, <i>Padwal</i>,
<i>W&aacute;lke</i>, <i>Apte</i>, <i>Ambekar</i>, <i>Pimpalkhare</i>,
<i>Kelkar</i> and <i>K&aacute;lke</i>.</p>
<p>The Hindus believe that a cow, a horse, and an elephant are sacred
animals. The cow is treated with special respect by the Hindus
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb79" href="#pb79" name=
"pb79">79</a>]</span>in general, and the bull by the Ling&aacute;yats
and oilmen. The milk, the urine, and the dung of a cow are used as
medicines, and they are also given as offerings to the god in
sacrifices.</p>
<p>The Shel&aacute;r family considers the sheep as their <i>devak</i>,
and they do not eat the flesh of a sheep. The Sh&aacute;lunke family
respects the <i>Sh&aacute;lunki</i> or sparrow. People belonging to the
More family do not eat the flesh of a peacock as they consider it to be
their <i>devak</i>.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e8933src" href=
"#xd27e8933" name="xd27e8933src">4</a></p>
<p>The Bhand&aacute;ris whose surname is Padwal do not eat the
vegetable of a snake-gourd or <i>Padwal</i>.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e8941src" href="#xd27e8941" name="xd27e8941src">5</a></p>
<p>Hindus do not eat the flesh of the animal respected by them, and
those who offer any fruit to their <i>guru</i> as a token of respect do
not eat that fruit in future. Some Hindus do not eat onions, garlic and
the fruit of a palm tree. The fruit of a tree believed to be the
<i>devak</i> of a family is not eaten by the members of that
family.</p>
<p>The families of R&aacute;va and R&aacute;ne do not take their food
on the leaf of a <i>Vad</i> or Banian tree as they consider it to be
their <i>devak</i>.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e8961src" href=
"#xd27e8961" name="xd27e8961src">6</a></p>
<p>There are some Hindu families in the Kol&aacute;ba District who
believe that their <i>kul</i> or totem consists of the tortoise and the
goat, and they do not eat the flesh of such animals. A certain
community of the <i>Vaishyas</i> or traders known as Sw&aacute;r
believe that a jack tree or <i>Phanas</i> is their <i>kul</i>, and they

<p>It is believed among the Hindus that the deity <i>Satw&aacute;i</i>
protects children for the first three months from their birth. The
deity is worshipped on the fifth day from the birth of a child, and if
there occurs any omission or error in the worship of that deity, the
child begins to cry, or does not keep good health. On such occasions
the parents of the child make certain vows to the deity, and if the
child recovers, the parents go to a jungle, and collect seven small
stones. They then besmear the stones with red lead and oil, and worship
them along with a <span class="corr" id="xd27e8989" title=

<p>The horse is connected with the worship of the god Khandoba because
this animal is sacred to that deity, being his favourite vehicle. For
this reason all the devotees or <i>Bhaktas</i> of Khandoba take care to
worship the horse in order that its master, the god Khandoba, may be
pleased with them.</p>
<p>It is well known that the cow is considered as most sacred of all
the animals by the Hindus, and the reason assigned for this special
veneration is that all the deities dwell in the cow.</p>
<p>The <i>Nandi</i>, or a bullock made of stone, consecrated in front
of the temple of Shiva, the <i>V&aacute;gh</i> or a tiger at the temple
of a goddess and cows and dogs in the temple of Datt&aacute;traya are
worshipped by the Hindus.</p>
<p>The mouse, being the vehicle of Ganpati the god of wisdom, is
worshipped by the people along with that god.</p>
<p>In the Konkan cattle are worshipped by the Hindus on the first day
of <i>K&aacute;rtika</i>, and they are made to pass over fire.</p>
<p>The mountains having caves and temples of deities are generally
worshipped by the Hindus. The Abucha Pah&aacute;d, the Girn&aacute;r,
the Panchmadhi, the Brahmagiri, the Sahy&aacute;dri, the Tung&aacute;r,
the Jivadancha <i>dongar</i>, the Munja <i>dongar</i> at Junnar, the
Tug&aacute;b&aacute;icha <i>dongar</i>, the Ganesh Lene, and the
Shivabai are the principal holy mountains in the Bombay Presidency.</p>
<p>Mount Abu, known as the Abucha Pah&aacute;d, is believed to be very
sacred, and many Hindus go on a pilgrimage to that mountain.</p>
<p>Hills are worshipped at Ganpati Pule and Chaul. At Pule there is a
temple of the god Ganpati, the son of Shiva, and at Chaul in the
Kol&aacute;ba District there is a temple of the god Datt&aacute;traya.

<p>The place which produces sound when water is poured over it is

<p>In the Deccan, hills are worshipped by the people on the <i>Narak
chaturdashi</i> day in <i>Dipaw&aacute;li</i>, 14th day of the dark
half of <i><span class="corr" id="xd27e9045" title=
"Source: Ashwin">Ashvin</span></i> (October). The legend of this
worship is that the god Shri Krishna lifted the Govardhan mountain on
this day, and protected the people of this world. A hill made of
cowdung is worshipped at every house on the <i>Narak chaturdashi</i>
day.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e9051src" href="#xd27e9051" name=

<p>Stones of certain kinds are first considered as one of the deities,
or as one of the chief heroes in the family, and then worshipped by the
people. Many such stones are found worshipped in the vicinity of any
temple.</p>
<p>A stone coming out of the earth with a phallus or <i>lingam</i> of
Shiva is worshipped by the Hindus. If such a <i>lingam</i> lies in a
deep jungle, it is worshipped by them at least once a year, and daily,
if practicable, in the month of <i>Adhikam&aacute;s</i>, an intercalary
month which comes every third year.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e9067src"
href="#xd27e9067" name="xd27e9067src">10</a></p>
<p>The red stones found in the Narmada river represent the god Ganpati,
and are worshipped by the people.</p>
<p>A big stone at Phutaka Tembha near Murud in the Ratn&aacute;giri
District is worshipped by the people, who believe it to be the monkey
god Hanum&aacute;n or M&aacute;ruti. All the stone images of gods that
are called <i>Swayambhu</i> or self-existent are nothing but rough
stones of peculiar shapes. There are such
<i>swayambhu</i>&mdash;natural-images&mdash;at Kelshi and Kolthare in
the Ratn&aacute;giri District.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e9080src"
href="#xd27e9080" name="xd27e9080src">11</a></p>
<p>There is a big stone at Palshet in the Ratn&aacute;giri District
which is worshipped as <i>K&aacute;lik&aacute;devi</i>.<a class=

<p>Stones are sometimes worshipped by the people in the belief that
they are haunted by evil spirits. We have for example a <span class=
"corr" id="xd27e9093" title="Source: stoen">stone</span> called <i>Mora
Dhonda</i> lying by the seashore at M&aacute;lwan in the
Ratn&aacute;giri District. It is supposed to be haunted by
<i>Devach&aacute;r</i>.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e9102src" href=
"#xd27e9102" name="xd27e9102src">13</a></p>
<p>The stones which are once consecrated and worshipped as deities have
to be continually worshipped, even when perforated. The small, round,
white stone slab known as <i>Vishnu pada</i>, which is naturally
perforated, is considered to be holy, and is worshipped daily by the
Hindus along with the other images of gods. The holes in this slab do
not extend right through.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e9110src" href=
"#xd27e9110" name="xd27e9110src">14</a></p>
<p>It is considered inauspicious to worship the fractured images of
gods, but the perforated black stone called
<i>Sh&aacute;ligr&aacute;m</i>, taken from the Gandaki river, is
considered very holy, and worshipped by the people. For it is believed
to be perforated from its very beginning. Every
<i>Sh&aacute;ligr&aacute;m</i> has a hole in it, even when it is in the
river.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e9121src" href="#xd27e9121" name=

<p>Broken stones are not worshipped by the people. But the household
gods of the Br&aacute;hmans and other higher classes which are called
the <i>Panch&aacute;yatan</i>&mdash;a collection of five
gods&mdash;generally consist of five stones with holes in
them.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e9129src" href="#xd27e9129" name=

<p>No instances of human sacrifices occur in India in these days, but
there are many practices and customs which appear to be the survivals
of human sacrifices. These survivals are visible in the offerings of
fowls, goats, buffaloes, and fruits like cocoanuts, brinjals, the
<i>Koh&aacute;le</i> or <span class="corr" id="xd27e9138" title=
"Source: pumpkion">pumpkin</span> gourd and others.</p>
<p>Human sacrifices are not practised in these days, but among the
Karh&aacute;da Br&aacute;hmans there is a practice of giving poison to
animals in order to satisfy their family deity. It is said that they
used to kill a Br&aacute;hman by giving him poisoned food.</p>
<p>It is believed that the people belonging to the caste of
Karh&aacute;da Br&aacute;hmans used to offer human sacrifices to their
deity, and therefore nobody relies on a Karh&aacute;da Br&aacute;hman
in these <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb81" href="#pb81" name=
"pb81">81</a>]</span>days. There is a proverb in Mar&aacute;thi which
means that a man can trust even a <i>Kas&aacute;i</i> or a butcher but
not a Karh&aacute;da.</p>
<p>As they cannot offer human sacrifices in these days, it is said that
during the <i>Navar&aacute;tra</i> holidays, <i>i.e.</i>, the first
nine days of the bright half of <i><span class="corr" id="xd27e9159"
title="Source: Ashwin">Ashvin</span></i> (October), they offer poisoned
food to crows, dogs and other animals.<a class="noteref" id=

<p>At K&aacute;lshe in the M&aacute;lwan taluka of the Ratn&aacute;giri
District, the servants of gods, <i>i.e.</i>, the ministrants or the
Bhopis of the temple prick their breast with a knife on the
<i>Dasara</i> day, and cry out loudly the words
&lsquo;<i>Koya</i>&rsquo; &lsquo;<i>Koya</i>&rsquo;. No blood comes
from the breast as the wound is slight. This appears to be a survival
of human sacrifice.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e9179src" href=

<p>In the Bombay Presidency, and more especially in the Konkan
districts, fetish stones are generally worshipped for the purpose of
averting evil and curing diseases. In every village stones are found
sacred to spirit deities like Bahiroba, Chedoba, Khandoba, Mhasoba,
Zoting, Vet&aacute;l, Jakh&aacute;i, Kok&aacute;i, Kalk&aacute;i and
others. The low class people such as Mah&aacute;rs, M&aacute;ngs, etc.,
apply red lead and oil to stones, and call them by one of the above
names, and ignorant people are very much afraid of such deities. They
believe that such deities have control over all the evil spirits or
ghosts. It is said that the spirit Vet&aacute;l starts to take a round
in a village on the night of the <span class="corr" id="xd27e9184"
title="Source: nomoon">no-moon</span> day of every month, accompanied
by all the ghosts. When any epidemic prevails in a village, people
offer to these fetish stones offerings of eatables, cocoanuts, fowls
and goats.</p>
<p>There is a stone deity named Bh&aacute;vai at Kokisare in the
B&aacute;vada State, to whom vows are made by the people to cure
diseases. As the deity is in the burning ground, it is naturally
believed that this is the abode of spirits.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e9189src" href="#xd27e9189" name="xd27e9189src">19</a></p>
<p>At Achare, in the M&aacute;lwan taluka of the Ratn&aacute;giri
District, the round stones known as <i>Kshetrap&aacute;l</i> are
supposed to possess the power of curing diseases, and are also believed
to be the abode of spirits.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e9200src" href=
"#xd27e9200" name="xd27e9200src">20</a></p>
<p>At Adivare, in the Ratn&aacute;giri District, there is a stone named
<i>Mah&aacute;r Purukha</i> which is worshipped by the people when
cattle disease prevails, especially the disease of a large tick or the
cattle or dog louse.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e9208src" href=
"#xd27e9208" name="xd27e9208src">21</a></p>
<p>At Ubh&aacute;d&aacute;nda, in the Ratn&aacute;giri District, there
are some stones which are believed to be haunted by Vet&aacute;l,
Bhutn&aacute;th, Rawaln&aacute;th and such other servants of the god
Shiva, and it is supposed that they have the power of curing epidemic
diseases. People make vows to these stones when any disease prevails in
the locality.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e9213src" href="#xd27e9213"

<p>The Hindus generally consider as sacred all objects that are the
means of their livelihood, and, for this reason, the oilmen worship
their oil-mill, the Br&aacute;hmans hold in veneration the sacred
thread&mdash;<i>Yadnopavit</i>,&mdash;and religious books, the
goldsmiths consider their firepots as sacred, and do not touch them
with their feet. In case any one accidently happens to touch them with
his foot, he apologises and bows to them.</p>
<p>It is believed by the Hindus that the broom, the winnowing fan, the
<i>p&aacute;yali</i>&mdash;a measure of four <i>shers</i><span class=
"corr" id="xd27e9229" title="Source: , ">&mdash;</span>the <i>Samai</i>
or sweet-oil lamp, a metal vessel, fire and <i>Sah&aacute;n</i> or the
levigating slab should not be touched with foot.</p>
<p>The metals gold, silver, and copper, the King&rsquo;s coins, jewels
and pearls, corns, the <i>Sh&aacute;ligr&aacute;m</i> stone, the
<i>Ganpati</i> stone from the Narmada river, conch-shell, sacred ashes,
elephant tusks, the horns of <span class="corr" id="xd27e9246" title=
"Source: an">a</span> wild ox (<i>Gava</i>), tiger skin, deer skin,
milk, curds, ghi, cow&rsquo;s urine, <i>Bel</i>, basil leaves or
<i>Tulsi</i>, cocoanuts, betelnuts, and flowers are considered as
sacred by the Hindus, and no one will dare to touch them with his foot.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb82" href="#pb82" name=

<p>Hindus worship annually on the <i>Dasara</i> day the arms and all
the instruments or implements by which they earn their livelihood. The
corn sieve, the winnowing basket, the broom, the rice-pounder, the
plough, the <i>Awuta</i> or wood bill, and other such implements are
worshipped on this day. The agriculturists respect their winnowing fans
and corn sieves, and do not touch them with their feet.</p>
<p>In the Kolh&aacute;pur District all the instruments and implements
are worshipped by the people one day previous to the <i>Dasara</i>
holiday. This worship is called <i>Kh&aacute;ndepujan</i>. They also
worship all agricultural instruments, and tie to them leaves of
<i>Pipal</i> and mango trees.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e9279src" href=
"#xd27e9279" name="xd27e9279src">23</a></p>
<p>A new winnowing fan is considered to be holy by the Hindus. It is
filled with rice, fruits, cocoanuts and betelnuts, and a
<i>Khana</i>&mdash;a piece of bodicecloth&mdash;is spread over it. It
is then worshipped and given to a Br&aacute;hman lady in fulfilment of
certain vows, or on the occasion of the worship of a Br&aacute;hman
<i>Dampatya</i> or married pair.</p>
<p>The broom is considered to be holy by the Hindus. Red
powder&mdash;<i>Kunku</i>&mdash;is applied to a new broom before it is
taken into use. It should not be touched with the feet.</p>
<p>At Rewadanda, in the Kol&aacute;ba District, some people worship a
wood-bill or <i>Koyata</i> on the 6th day from the birth of a child.
The rice-pounder, or <i>Musal</i>, is worshipped by them as a
<i>devak</i> at the time of thread and marriage ceremonies.<a class=

<p>Fire is considered to be holy among the high class Hindus. It is
considered as an angel that conveys the sacrificial offerings from this
earth to the gods in heaven. It is considered as one of the Hindu
deities, and worshipped daily by high class Hindus. A Br&aacute;hman
has to worship the fire every day in connection with the ceremony
<i>Vaishwadeva</i>&mdash;oblations of boiled rice and ghi given to the
fire. It is also worshipped by the Hindus on special religious
occasions.</p>
<p>Fire is worshipped at the time of <i>Yadnas</i> or Sacrifices.
Sacrifices are of five kinds. They are<span class="corr" id="xd27e9321"
title="Not in source">:</span>&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Devayadna</i>, <i>Bhutayadna</i> or <i>Brahmayadna</i>,
<i>Rishiyadna</i> or <i>Atithiyadna</i>, <i>Pitruyadna</i> and
<i>Manushyayadna</i>. The offerings of rice, ghi, firewood, <i>Til</i>
or sesamum, <i>Java</i> or barley, etc. are made in these
<i>yadnas</i>. It is also worshipped at the time of
<i>Shr&aacute;vani</i> or <i>Up&aacute;karma</i>&mdash;the ceremony of
renewing the sacred thread annually in the month of
<i>Shr&aacute;van</i>.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e9366src" href=
"#xd27e9366" name="xd27e9366src">25</a></p>
<p>Among the lower classes fire is worshipped on the
<i>Mah&aacute;laya</i> or <i>Shr&aacute;ddha</i> day. They throw
oblations of food into the fire on that day.</p>
<p>The fire produced by rubbing sticks of the <i>Pipal</i> or
<i>Shevari</i> tree is considered sacred, and it is essentially
necessary that the sacred fire required for the <i>Agnihotra</i> rites
should be produced in the manner described above.</p>
<p><i>Agnihotra</i> is a perpetual sacred fire preserved in
<i>Agnikunda</i>,&mdash;a hole in the ground for receiving and
preserving consecrated fire. A Br&aacute;hman, who has to accept the
<i>Agnihotra</i>, has to preserve in his house the sacred fire day and
night after his thread ceremony, and to worship it three times a day
after taking his bath. When an <i>Agnihotri</i> dies, his body is burnt
by the people who prepare fire by rubbing sticks of <i>Pipal</i> wood
together.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e9408src" href="#xd27e9408" name=
"xd27e9408src">26</a></p>
<p>There are some Br&aacute;hmans who keep the fire continuously
burning in their houses only for <i>Ch&aacute;turm&aacute;s</i> or four
months of the year. The fire which is preserved and worshipped for four
months is called &ldquo;<i>Sm&aacute;rta Agni</i>.&rdquo;<a class=

<h2 class="label">CHAPTER IX.</h2>
<h2 class="main"><i>ANIMAL WORSHIP.</i></h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The following animals, birds and insects are respected
by the Hindus:&mdash;The cow, bullock, she-buffalo, horse, elephant,
tiger, deer, mouse, goat, ants and alligators; and among the birds the
following are held sacred<span class="corr" id="xd27e9431" title=
"Source: .">:</span>&mdash;Peacock, swan, eagle and <i>kokil</i> or
cuckoo.</p>
<p>Of all the animals the cow is considered to be the most sacred by
Hindus. It is generally worshipped daily in the morning for the whole
year, or at least for the <i>Ch&aacute;turm&aacute;s</i> or four months
beginning from the 11th day of the bright half of <i>Ash&aacute;dha</i>
to the 11th day of the bright half of the month of
<i>K&aacute;rtika</i>; and a special worship is offered to it in the
evening on the 12th day of the dark half of <i><span class="corr" id=
"xd27e9449" title="Source: Ashwin">Ashvin</span></i> (October).</p>
<p>The cow is believed to be the abode of all the deities and
<i>rishis</i>. It is compared with the earth in its sacredness, and it
is considered that when it is pleased it is capable of giving
everything required for the maintenance of mankind, and for this reason
it is styled the <i>K&aacute;ma Dhenu</i> or the giver of desired
objects. It is said that a person who walks round the cow at the time
of its delivery obtains the <i>punya</i> or merit of going round the
whole earth. The cow is even worshipped by the god Vishnu.</p>
<p>The cow is considered next to a mother, as little children and the
people in general are fed by the milk of a cow. Some women among high
class Hindus take a vow not to take their meals before worshipping the
cow, and when the cow is not available for worship, they draw in
turmeric, white or red powder the cow&rsquo;s foot-prints and worship
the same. At the completion of the vow it is worshipped, and then given
as a gift to a Br&aacute;hman. It is considered very meritorious to
give a <i>Goprad&aacute;n</i>&mdash;a gift of a cow along with its
calf<span class="corr" id="xd27e9468" title=
"Source: , ">&mdash;</span>to a Br&aacute;hman. The sight of a cow in
the morning is believed by all Hindus to be auspicious.</p>
<p>The bullock is respected by the people as it is the favourite
vehicle of the god Shiva, and is very useful for agricultural purposes.
The <i>Nandi</i> or bull is worshipped by Hindus. The bullock is
specially worshipped on the 12th day of the bright half of
<i>K&aacute;rtika</i>. When performing the funeral rites of the dead, a
bull is worshipped and set free. The bull thus set free is considered
sacred by the people, and is never used again for agricultural or any
other domestic purposes.</p>
<p>In order to avoid calamities arising from the influence of
inauspicious planets, Hindus worship the she-buffalo, and offer it as a
gift to a Br&aacute;hman. The she-buffalo is compared with the
<i>K&aacute;l Purusha</i> or the god of Death, the reason being that
Yama is believed to ride a buffalo. The Br&aacute;hman who accepts this
gift has to shave his moustaches and to undergo a certain penance. The
cowherds sometimes worship the she-buffalo. As it is the vehicle of
Yama, the buffalo is specially worshipped by people when an epidemic
occurs in a village. In certain villages in the Konkan districts the
buffalo is worshipped and sacrificed on the same day.</p>
<p>The horse is the vehicle of the deity Khandoba of Jejuri. It is
worshipped on the <i>Vijaya Dashami</i> or the <i>Dasara</i> holiday as
in former days, on the occasion of the horse sacrifice or
<i>Ashwamedha</i>.</p>
<p>The elephant is the vehicle of the god Indra and is specially
worshipped on the <i>Dasara</i> day. It is also believed that there are
eight sacred <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb84" href="#pb84" name=
"pb84">84</a>]</span>elephants posted at the eight directions. These
are called <i>Ashtadik-P&aacute;las</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, the protectors of
the eight different directions, and they are worshipped along with
other deities on auspicious ceremonial occasions, like weddings,
thread-girding, etc.</p>
<p>The deer and the tiger are considered to be holy by Hindus, and
their skins are used by Br&aacute;hmans and ascetics while performing
their austerities. The deer skin is used on the occasion of thread
girding. A small piece of the deer skin is tied to the neck of the boy
along with the new sacred thread.</p>
<p>The mouse, being the vehicle of the god Ganpati, is worshipped along
with that deity on the <i>Ganesh Chaturthi</i> day, the fourth day of
the bright half of <i>Bh&aacute;drapada</i>.</p>
<p>The goat is believed to be holy for sacrificial purposes. It is
worshipped at the time of its sacrifice, which is performed to gain the
favour of certain deities.</p>
<p>The ass is generally considered as unholy by the Hindus, and its
mere touch is held to cause pollution. But certain lower class Hindus
like the Lon&aacute;ris consider it sacred, and worship it on the
<i>Gokul <span class="corr" id="xd27e9525" title=
"Source: Ashthami">Ashtami</span></i> day (8th day of the dark half of
<i>Shr&aacute;wan</i>).</p>
<p>The dog is believed to be an incarnation of the deity Khandoba, and
it is respected as the favourite animal of the god Datt&aacute;traya.
But it is not touched by high class Hindus.</p>
<p>It is considered a great sin to kill a cat.</p>
<p>All domestic animals are worshipped by the Hindus on the morning of
the first day of <i>M&aacute;rgashirsha</i> (December).</p>
<p>On this day the horns of these animals are washed with warm water,
painted with red colours, and a lighted lamp is passed round their
faces. They are feasted on this day as it is considered to be the gala
day (<i>Div&aacute;li</i> holiday) of the animals.</p>
<p>Hindus consider it meritorious to feed ants and fish, and to throw
grain to the birds. Ants are fed by the people scattering sugar and
flour on the ant-hills. It is believed that, by feeding the ants with
sugar or flour, a person obtains the <i>Punya</i> or merit of
<i>sahasrabhojan</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, of giving a feast to a thousand
Br&aacute;hmans.</p>
<p>Alligators are worshipped as water deities by the Hindus.</p>
<p>The peacock is the favourite vehicle of Saraswati, the Goddess of
Learning, and it is therefore respected by the people.</p>
<p>The swan is the vehicle of Brahma, the god of creation.</p>
<p>The eagle is the vehicle of the god Vishnu, and is a favourite
devotee of that deity. It is therefore held sacred by Hindus.</p>
<p>The cuckoo or <i>Kokil</i> is believed to be an incarnation of the
goddess P&aacute;rwati. This bird is specially worshipped by high caste
Hindu women for the period of one month on the occasion of a special
festival called the festival of the cuckoos, or <i>Kokila vrata</i>,
which is held in the month of <i>Ash&aacute;dha</i> at intervals of
twenty years.</p>
<p>The crow is generally held inauspicious by Hindus, but as the
<i>manes</i> or <i>pitras</i> are said to assume the form of crows,
these birds are respected in order that they may be able to partake of
the food offered to the dead ancestors in the dark half of
<i>Bh&aacute;drapada</i> called <i>Pitrupaksha</i>.</p>
<p>It is necessary that the oblations given in performance of the
funeral rites on the tenth day after the death of a person should be
eaten by the crow. But if the crow refuses to touch these oblations, it
is believed that the soul of the dead has not obtained salvation; and
hence it is conjectured that certain wishes of the dead have remained
unfulfilled. The son or the relatives of the dead then take water in
the cavity of their right hand, and solemnly promise to fulfil the
wishes of the dead. When this is done, the crow begins to eat the
food.</p>
<p>The harsh sound of a crow is taken as a sure sign of an impending
mishap.</p>
<p>The dog, cat, pig, ass, buffalo, rat, <i>bh&aacute;lu</i>, an old
female jackal, lizard, and the birds cock, crow, kite, vulture, owl,
bat, and <i>pingla</i> are considered as unholy and inauspicious by
Hindus. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb85" href="#pb85" name=

<h2 class="label">CHAPTER X.</h2>
<h2 class="main"><i>WITCHCRAFT.</i></h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first"><i>Chetak</i> is an art secretly learnt by women. It
is a form of the black art. A woman well versed in the <i>mantras</i>
of <i>chetak</i> can do any mischief she chooses. She can kill a child
or turn any person into a dog or other animal by the power of her
incantations. The <i>Chetakin</i> can remove all the hair from the head
of a woman, or scatter filth, etc. in a person&rsquo;s house, make
marks of crosses with marking nuts on all the clothes, or play many
other such tricks without betraying a trace of the author of the
mischief. The <i>chetakins</i> are able to mesmerize a man and order
him to do anything they want. A <i>Chetakin</i> or witch cannot herself
appear in the form of an animal.</p>
<p>They follow revolting forms of ceremonies. All witches who have
learnt the black art meet at night once a month on the <i><span class=
"corr" id="xd27e9631" title=
"Source: Amav&aacute;sya">Am&aacute;v&aacute;sya</span></i> day or no
moon day of every month, at a burning ground outside the village. On
such occasions they go quite naked, and apply turmeric and red powders
to the body and forehead. While coming to the cremation ground they
bring on their heads burning coals in an earthen pot called
<i>Kondi</i>. At this meeting they repeat their <i>mantras</i>, and
take care that none are forgotten. After completing the repetition of
the <i>mantras</i>, they go round the village and return to their
respective houses. They have no special haunts or seasons.</p>
<p>In the Kolh&aacute;pur District the woman who is in possession of a
<i>chetak</i> is called <i>chetakin</i>. The <i>chetak</i> is said to
abide by her orders. It is believed to bring corn and other things from
houses or harvesting grounds. It is seen only by its mistress the
<i>chetakin</i>. The belief that the <i>chetakins</i> can turn a person
into the form of an animal does not prevail in this district. They do
not wander from one place to another. The <i>chetakin</i> has to go
once a year to the temple of the deity from whom the <i>chetak</i> has
been brought, and to pay the annual tribute for the use of that
<i>chetak</i> or servant spirit.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e9670src"
href="#xd27e9670" name="xd27e9670src">1</a></p>
<p>There are no witches in the Ratn&aacute;giri District. It is said
that there are some at Kolwan in the Th&aacute;na District. They are
generally found among Th&aacute;kars. Some of them come to the
Ratn&aacute;giri District, but though no one can tell anything about
their powers, ignorant people are very much afraid of them.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e9675src" href="#xd27e9675" name="xd27e9675src">2</a>
It is believed that they can turn persons into animals by means of
their incantations. The person once charmed by their <i>mantras</i> is
said to blindly abide by their orders. It is also believed that they
can ruin anybody by their magic.</p>
<p>There are no witches at R&aacute;i in the Th&aacute;na District. The
woman who can influence evil spirits to do harm to others is called a
<i>Bhut&aacute;li</i>. It is said that the <i>Bhut&aacute;lis</i>
assemble at the funeral ground in a naked state on the full-moon day
and on the <i>Am&aacute;v&aacute;sya</i>, or the last day of every
month, to refresh their knowledge of the black art.<a class="noteref"
id="xd27e9692src" href="#xd27e9692" name="xd27e9692src">3</a></p>
<p>A witch has dirty habits and observances. The chief sign for
detecting a witch or <i>chetakin</i> is a foam or froth that appears on
the lips of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb86" href="#pb86" name=
"pb86">86</a>]</span>her mouth when she is asleep. The only means to
guard against her witchcraft is to remain on friendly terms with her,
and not to hurt her feelings on any occasion. People generally keep a
watch over the actions of a woman who is suspected to be a witch, and
if she is found practising her black art, and is caught red-handed,
people then pour into her mouth water brought from the
shoe-maker&rsquo;s earthen pot or <i>kundi</i>. It is believed that,
when she is compelled to drink such water, her black art becomes
ineffective.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e9705src" href="#xd27e9705"
name="xd27e9705src">4</a></p>
<p>In the Th&aacute;na District it is believed that the skin round the
eyes of a witch is always black, her eyes have an intoxicated
appearance, her nails are generally parched and have a darkish colour,
and the lower portions of her feet seem to be scraped. When any
sorcerer gives out the name of such a <i>Bhut&aacute;li</i>, she is
threatened by the people that, should she continue to give trouble in
the village, her own black art or another spirit would be set against
her; and she then ceases to give trouble.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e9713src" href="#xd27e9713" name="xd27e9713src">5</a></p>
<p>There are some sorcerers in the Th&aacute;na District who can move a
small brass cup or <i>v&aacute;ti</i> by the power of their magic. They
can detect a witch by the movement of this vessel. When the brass
vessel or <i>v&aacute;ti</i> reaches the house of a witch, it at once
settles upon the witch&rsquo;s head. She is then threatened by the
people that she will be driven out of the village if found practising
her black art.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e9724src" href="#xd27e9724"
name="xd27e9724src">6</a></p>
<p>In the Kolh&aacute;pur District, when the people come to know of the
existence of a witch in their village, they take special precautions at
the time of harvest. They arrange to harvest a different kind of grain
to the one selected for harvesting by the witch. After some time they
go to the field of the witch, and discover whether there is a mixture
of grain in her field. If they are convinced of the fact, they take
further precautions. In order to avoid being troubled by the
<i>chetak</i>, they keep an old, worn out shoe or sandal and a charmed
copper amulet under the eaves at the main door of their houses, or make
crosses with marking nut on both sides of a door. At some places
<i>chunam</i> spots or circles are marked on the front of a house, the
object being to guard against the evil effects of the
<i>chetak&rsquo;s</i> tricks.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e9738src" href=

<p class="first">Offerings of cocoanuts, fowls or goats are annually
made to the spirits that guard the fields. They are generally made at
the time of beginning a plantation or the harvesting of a crop. When
making these offerings, the farmers pray to the god to give prosperous
crops every year. They prepare their cooked food in the field on the
first harvesting day and offer it as <i>naivedya</i> (god&rsquo;s meal)
along with the above mentioned offerings.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e9756src" href="#xd27e9756" name="xd27e9756src">1</a></p>
<p>At B&aacute;ndivade in the Ratn&aacute;giri District, while
commencing the sowing of crops the farmers worship a certain number of
bullocks made of rice <span class="corr" id="xd27e9761" title=
"Source: floor">flour</span> and then throw them into the pond or river
adjoining the fields. On other occasions, offerings of cocoanuts and
fowls are sacrificed to the deities that protect the fields. Some
people give a feast to the Br&aacute;hmans at the end of the harvesting
season.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e9764src" href="#xd27e9764" name=
"xd27e9764src">2</a></p>
<p>Ceremonies in connection with ploughing, etc., are not observed for
all the lands. But fields which are supposed to be haunted by evil
spirits are worshipped at the time of ploughing, and the evil spirits
are propitiated, cocoanuts, sugar, fowls or goats are offered to the
local deities or <i>devach&aacute;rs</i>. There is a custom of
worshipping in the fields the heaps of new corn at the time of harvest,
and this custom generally prevails in almost all the Konkan
districts.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e9772src" href="#xd27e9772" name=
"xd27e9772src">3</a></p>
<p>At <span class="corr" title="Source: Fonde">Fonda</span> in the
Ratn&aacute;giri District the <i>Shiwar</i> generally composed of
boiled rice mixed with curds is kept at the corner of a field at the
time of reaping the crops. The <i>Shiwar</i> is sometimes composed of
the offerings of fowls and goats.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e9786src"
href="#xd27e9786" name="xd27e9786src">4</a> This ritual is also known
by the name <i>Chorawa</i>.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e9796src" href=
"#xd27e9796" name="xd27e9796src">5</a></p>
<p>At D&aacute;sg&aacute;v in the Kol&aacute;ba District, there is a
custom of carrying one onion in the corn taken to the fields for sowing
and placing five handfuls of corn on a piece of cloth before beginning
to sow the corn. At the time of <i>L&aacute;wani</i> or plantation of
crops a fair called <i>Palejatra</i> is held by the people, and every
farmer breaks a cocoanut in the field at the time of plantation or
<i>l&aacute;vani</i> of crops. At the time of harvesting it is
customary with many of the cultivators in the Konkan to place a
cocoanut in the field and to thrash it by the first bundle of crop
several times before the regular operation of thrashing is begun. At
the close of the harvest the peasants offer cocoanuts, fowls or a goat
to the guardian deity of the field.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e9810src"
href="#xd27e9810" name="xd27e9810src">6</a></p>
<p>At V&aacute;da in the Th&aacute;na District the ploughs are
worshipped by the farmers on Saturday and then carried to the fields
for ploughing. At the time of harvesting, the wooden post to which the
bullocks are tied is worshipped by them and at the close of the harvest
the heap of new corn is worshipped and cocoanuts are broken over
it.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e9815src" href="#xd27e9815" name=
"xd27e9815src">7</a></p>
<p>In the Kolh&aacute;pur District the farmers worship the plough
before beginning to plough the land. At the time of sowing the corn
they worship the <i>Kuri</i> an implement for sowing corn. At the time
of <i>Ropani</i> or transplanting the crops they split a cocoanut, and
worship the stone consecrated by the side of the field after besmearing
it with red powders, and make a vow of sacrificing a goat for the
prosperity of their crops. At the time of harvesting they also worship
the heap of new corn and after giving to the deity offerings of
cocoanuts, fowls or goats they carry the corn to their houses.<a class=

<p>In the Konkan districts the village deity is invoked to protect the
cattle. People offer fowls and cocoanuts in the annual fair of a
village deity, and request her to protect their cattle and crops. They
have to offer a goat or buffalo to the deity every third year, and to
hold annual fairs in her honour. The procession of <i>bali</i> is one
of the measures adopted for averting cattle diseases.<a class="noteref"

<p>When there was scarcity of rain the Hindus formerly invoked Indra,
the god of rain, by means of <i>Yadnyas</i> or sacrifices, but such
sacrifices are now rarely performed as they are very costly. The
general method of ensuring rainfall in these days is to drown the
<i>Lingam</i> of the god Shiva in water and to offer prayers to that
deity.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e9846src" href="#xd27e9846" name=

<p>The following rural rites are intended to ensure sunshine and to
check excessive rain. A man born in the month of <i>F&aacute;lgun</i>
(March) is requested to collect rain water in the leaf of the
<i>Alu</i> plant, and the leaf is then tied to a stick and kept on the
roof of a house. Burning coals are also thrown into rainwater after

<p>In the Kolh&aacute;pur District the deities
Tamj&aacute;i<span class="corr" title="Not in source">,</span>
Tung&aacute;i, and W&aacute;gh&aacute;i are invoked by the villagers
for the protection of cattle. When the cattle disease has disappeared
the people offer cocoanuts and other offerings to these deities. The
potters and the Chudbude Joshis observe the following ceremony for
causing rainfall. A <i>lingam</i> or phallus of Shiva made of mud is
consecrated on a wooden board or <i>p&aacute;t</i>, and a naked boy is
asked to hold it over his head. The boy carries it from house to house
and the inmates of the houses pour water over the phallus. The
Br&aacute;hmans and the high class Hindus pour water on the
<i>lingam</i> at the temple of the god Shiva continuously for several
days. This is called <i>Rudr&aacute;bhisheka</i>. It is a religious
rite in which eleven Br&aacute;hmans are seated in a temple to repeat
the prayers of the god Shiva.</p>
<p>In order to scare noxious animals or insects from the fields, the
owners of the fields throw charmed rice round the boundaries of their
fields. The figure of a tiger made of dry leaves of sugarcane is posted
at a conspicuous place in the fields for protecting the crops of
sugarcane.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e9900src" href="#xd27e9900" name=

<p>Great secrecy is required to be observed on the occasion of the
special <i>puja</i> of Shiva which is performed on the first day of the
bright half of the month of <i>Bh&aacute;drapada</i> (September). This
rite is called <i>Maunya vrata</i> or silent worship, and should be
performed only by the male members of the family. On this day all the
members of the family have to remain silent while taking their meals.
Women do not speak while cooking, as the food which is to be offered to
the god must be cooked in silence.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e9914src"

<p>Newly married girls have to perform the worship of Mangala Gauri
successively for the first five years on every Tuesday in the month of
<i>Shr&aacute;wan</i> (August), and it is enjoined that they should not
speak while taking their meals on that day. Some people do not speak
while taking their meals on every Monday of <i>Shr&aacute;wan</i>, and
others make a vow of observing silence and secrecy at their meals every
day. All Br&aacute;hmans have to remain silent when going to the closet
and making water.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e9925src" href="#xd27e9925"

day of the bright half of <i>Ash&aacute;dha</i> (July) to the 11th day
of the bright half of <i>K&aacute;rtik</i> (November). Certain classes

<p>At V&aacute;de in the Th&aacute;na District, one day previous to the
planting of rice crops the farmer has to go to his field even before
day break with five balls of boiled rice, cocoanuts and other things.
There he worships the guardian deity of the field and buries the balls
of rice underground. He has to do it secretly and has to remain silent
during the whole period. He is also forbidden to look behind while
going to the field for the purpose.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e9983src"

<p>Secrecy and silence are observed when performing the rites of
<i>Chetuks</i> and evil spirits or ghosts. Widow remarriages among the
lower classes are performed secretly. The pair wishing to be remarried
is accompanied by a Br&aacute;hman priest and the marriage is performed
apart from the house. The priest applies red lead (<i>Kunku</i>) to the
forehead of the bride and throws grains of rice over their heads and a
stone mortar or <i>p&aacute;ta</i> is touched to the backbone of the

<p>The <i>Holi</i> is a religious festival. It is annually celebrated
in memory of the death of K&aacute;mdev the God of Love who was
destroyed by the god Shankar on the full moon day of
<i>F&aacute;lgun</i> (March). The object of this festival appears to
have been a desire to abstain from lust by burning in the <i>Holi</i>
fire all vicious thoughts and desires. As a rule, females do not take
any part in this festival.</p>
<p>In the Konkan districts the annual festival of <i>Holi</i> begins
from the fifth day of the bright half of <i>F&aacute;lgun</i> (March).
Boys from all the localities of a village assemble at a place appointed
for the <i>Holi</i>. The place appointed for kindling the <i>Holi</i>
is not generally changed. The boys then go from house to house asking
for firewood, and bring it to the <i>Holi</i> spot. They arrange the
firewood and other combustible articles around the branch of a mango,
betelnut or a <i>S&aacute;war</i> tree in the pit dug out for the
purpose and then set it on fire. After kindling the sacred fire they
take five turns round the <i>Holi</i> accompanied with the beating of
drums and raise loud cries of obscene words. After this they play the
Indian games of <i>Aty&aacute;p&aacute;tya</i> and <i>Khokho</i> and
occasionally rob the neighbouring people of their firewood and other
combustible articles. At the close of these games they daub their
foreheads with sacred ashes gathered from the <i>Holi</i> fire. They
consider these ashes especially auspicious and carry them home for the
use of the other members of their families. This process is continued
every night till the close of the fullmoon day. Elderly persons take
part in this festival only during the last few days.</p>
<p>On the fullmoon day all the males of the village, including old men,
start after sunset for the <i>Holi</i> spot, collecting on their way
pieces of firewood from all the houses in the locality and arrange them
in the manner described above. After having arranged the <i>Holi</i>,
the officiating priest recites sacred verses and the <i>puja</i> is
performed by the <i>m&aacute;nkari</i> of the village. This
<i>m&aacute;nkari</i> or <i>p&aacute;til</i> is either the headman or
some other leading person of the village and to him belongs the right
of kindling the <i>Holi</i> fire first. Some persons kindle a small
<i>Holi</i> in front of their houses and worship it individually, but
they can take part in the public <i>Holi</i>. In the towns the
<i>Holis</i> of different localities are kindled separately while in
small villages there is only one for every village.</p>
<p>At Vijaydurg in the Ratn&aacute;giri District a hen is tied to the
top of a tree or a bamboo placed in the pit dug out for kindling the
<i>Holi</i> fire. The fowl tied to the top of the bamboo is called
<i>Shit</i>. A small quantity of dry grass is first burnt at the bottom
of this tree when the Mah&aacute;rs beat their drums. The <i>Shit</i>
(fowl) is then removed from the tree after it is half burnt and taken
by the Mah&aacute;rs. The <i>Holi</i> fire is then worshipped and
kindled by the Gurav. Worshipping and kindling the <i>Holi</i> and
taking the <i>Shit</i> (fowl) are considered as high honours.
Occasionally quarrels and differences arise over this privilege and
they are decided by the village <i>Panch</i>.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e10102src" href="#xd27e10102" name="xd27e10102src">21</a>
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb90" href="#pb90" name=
"pb90">90</a>]</span></p>
<p>After the kindling of the <i>Holi</i> the people assembled there
offer to the <i>Holi</i> a <i>Naivedya</i> (god&rsquo;s meal) of
<i>poli</i>&mdash;a sweet cake made of <i>Jagri</i>, wheat flour and
gram pulse. Cocoanuts from all the houses in the village are thrown
into this sacred fire. Some of these cocoanuts are afterwards taken out
of the sacred fire, cut into pieces, mixed with sugar and are
distributed among the people assembled as <i>pras&aacute;d</i> or
favoured gift. Lower classes of Hindus offer a live goat to the
<i>Holi</i>, take it out when it is half burnt and feast thereon.</p>
<p>On the night of the fullmoon day and the first day of the dark half
of <i>F&aacute;lgun</i>, the people assembled at the <i>Holi</i> fire
wander about the village, enter gardens and steal plantains, cocoanuts
and other garden produce. Robbery of such things committed during these
days is considered to be pardonable. Some people take advantage of this
opportunity for taking revenge on their enemies in this respect.</p>
<p>The fire kindled at the <i>Holi</i> on the fullmoon day is kept
constantly burning till the <i>Rangpanchami</i> day <i>i.e.</i>, fifth
day of the dark half of <i>F&aacute;lgun</i>. Next morning <i>i.e.</i>,
on the first day of the dark half of <i>F&aacute;lgun</i>, the people
boil water over that fire and use it for the purpose of bathing. It is
believed that water boiled on the sacred fire has the power of
dispelling all the diseases from the body. People go on dancing in the
village and sing songs for the next five days. They generally sing
<i>L&aacute;vanis</i>, a kind of ballad, during this festival. Among
these dancers a boy is dressed like a girl and is called
<i>R&aacute;dha</i>. This <i>R&aacute;dha</i> has to dance at every
house while the others repeat <i>L&aacute;vanis</i>.</p>
<p>The second day of the dark half of <i>F&aacute;lgun</i> is called
<i>Dhulvad</i> or dust day when people start in procession through the
village, and compel the males of every house to join the party. They
thus go to the <i>Holi</i> fire and raise loud cries of obscene words
throwing mud and ashes upon each other. They afterwards go to the river
or a pond to take their bath at noon time and then return to their
houses. The third day of the dark half is also spent like the previous
one with a slight difference which is that cow dung is used instead of
mud. This day is called <i>Shenwad</i> day. On the fourth day the
Dhunda R&aacute;kshahasin (a demon goddess) is worshipped by the
people, and the day is spent in making merry and singing obscene songs
called <i>L&aacute;vanis</i>. The fifth day of the dark half is known
as <i>Rangpanchami</i> day and is observed by the people in throwing
coloured water upon each other. Water in which <i>Kusumba</i> and other
colours are mixed is carried in large quantity on bullock carts through
the streets of a city and sprinkled on the people passing through these
streets. On this day the sacred fire of the <i>Holi</i> is extinguished
by throwing coloured water over it. This water is also thrown upon the
persons assembled at the <i>Holi</i>. The money collected as
<i>post</i> during this period is utilised in feasting and
drinking.</p>

District the image of cupid is seated in a palanquin and carried with

placed on a certain spot. The place for thus depositing the image of
the god is called S&aacute;h&aacute;n.<a class="noteref" id=

<i>M&aacute;nkari</i>, and then from house to house during the next
five days. The inmates of the houses worship the deity in the palanquin
and offer cocoanuts and other fruits and make certain vows. The
palanquin is taken back to the temple on the fifth day of the dark half
of <i>F&aacute;lgun</i> when on its way <i>gul&aacute;l</i> or red

<p>Among high class Hindus the thread girding ceremony of a boy is
performed when he attains puberty. The girls are generally married
<span class="corr" id="xd27e10252" title="Source: a">at</span> an early
age, and when a girl attains puberty, sugar is distributed among the
friends and relatives of her husband. She is then seated in a
<i>Makhar</i>&mdash;a gaily dressed frame. Dishes of sweets which are
brought by the girl&rsquo;s <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb91" href=
"#pb91" name="pb91">91</a>]</span>parents and the relatives of her
husband are given to her for the first three days. She takes her bath
on the fourth day accompanied by the playing of music and the beating
of drums. Sweetmeats in dishes are brought by the relatives till the
day of <i>Rutushanti</i> (the first bridal night). The
<i>Garbh&aacute;d&aacute;n</i> or <i>Rutush&aacute;nti</i> ceremony is
one of the sixteen ceremonies that are required to be performed during
the life of every Hindu. This ceremony is performed within the first
sixteen days from the girl&rsquo;s attaining her puberty, the 4th, 7th,
9th, 11th and the 13th being considered inauspicious for this purpose.
While performing this ceremony the following three rites are required
to be observed. They are <i>Ganpatipujan</i> or the worship of the god
<i>Ganpati</i>, <i>Punhy&aacute;havachan</i> or the special ceremony
for invoking divine blessings and <i>Navagrahash&aacute;nti</i> the
ceremony for propitiating the nine planets. The ritual of this ceremony
is as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>The husband and the wife are seated side by side on wooden boards to
perform the above three rites. The <i>Kadali pujan</i> or plantain tree
worship is performed by the pair. The sacred fire or <i>Homa</i> is
required to be kindled. The juice of the <i>Durwa</i> grass is then
poured into the right nostril of the bride by her husband. This is
intended to expel all diseases from the body of the girl and to secure
safe conception. They are then seated in a <i>Makhar</i>, and presents
of clothes, ornaments etc., are made by the parents of the girl and
other relatives. After this the husband fills the lap of the girl with
rice, a cocoanut, five betelnuts, five dry dates, five almonds, five
plantains and five pieces of turmeric. The girl is then carried to a
temple accompanied by the playing of music. <span class="corr" id=
"xd27e10296" title="Source: Agrand">A grand</span> feast is given to
the friends and relatives at the close of this ceremony.</p>
<p>The Hindus generally make various kinds of vows in order to procure
offspring or with some other such object, and fulfil them when they
succeed in getting their desire. The following are the different kinds
of vows made. They offer cocoanuts, sugar, plantains and other fruits,
costly new dresses and ornaments to the deities, and give feasts to
Br&aacute;hmans. Special ceremonies called <i>Laghurudra</i> and
<i>Mah&aacute;rudra</i> in honour of Shiva the god of destruction are
also performed. Sweetmeats such as <i>pedhas</i> etc. are offered to
the gods in fulfilment of vows. Some people make vows to observe fasts,
to feed Br&aacute;hmans, and to distribute coins and clothes to the
poor; while others hang <i>torana</i>-wreaths of flowers and mango
leaves&mdash;on the entrance of the temple, and hoist flags over it.
Rich people erect new temples to different Hindu deities. Some observe
fasts to propitiate the goddess Chandika and worship her during
<i>Navar&aacute;tra</i> the first nine days of the bright half of
<i>Ashvin</i> (October) and others offer fowls and goats to their
favourite deities. Women make it a vow to walk round the
<i>Audumbar</i> or <i>Pipal</i> tree, and to distribute cocoanuts,
sugar, jagri, copper or silver equal to the weight of their
children.</p>
<p>Vows are made by people with the object of securing health, wealth
and children and other desired objects such as education etc. They are
as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>Performing the worship of Shri Satya N&aacute;r&aacute;yan, offering
clothes and ornaments to the temple deities, hanging bells,
constructing a foot path or steps leading to the temple of the special
deity.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e10331src" href="#xd27e10331" name=
"xd27e10331src">25</a> Vows are also made to obtain freedom from
disease or such other calamities. When any person in the family becomes
ill or when a sudden calamity befalls a family an elderly member of the
family goes to the temple of a deity and makes certain vows according
to his means, fulfilling them as soon as the calamity or disease has
disappeared.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e10337src" href="#xd27e10337"
name="xd27e10337src">26</a></p>
<p>Vows are usually to perform acts of benevolence. These consist in
distributing cocoanut mixed in sugar, giving feasts to Br&aacute;hman
priests, observing fasts on Saturday, Tuesday and Sunday, offering
clothes and ornaments to deities, building new temples and guest houses
(<i>dharmsh&aacute;l&aacute;s</i>), digging out new wells and in
distributing clothes and food to the poor.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e10345src" href="#xd27e10345" name="xd27e10345src">27</a></p>
<p>At Khopoli in the Kol&aacute;ba District, people who have no
children or whose children die shortly after birth make a vow to the
Satw&aacute;i deity whose temple is at a short distance from Khopoli.
The vow is generally to bring the child to the <i>darshana</i> (sight)
of the deity and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb92" href="#pb92" name=
"pb92">92</a>]</span>to feed five or more (married) Br&aacute;hman
pairs. Such vows are fulfilled after the birth of a child. Some worship
the god Satya N&aacute;r&aacute;yan on a grand scale and others
propitiate the god Shiva by the ceremony of <i>Abhisheka</i> (water
sprinkling).<a class="noteref" id="xd27e10358src" href="#xd27e10358"
name="xd27e10358src">28</a> Some offer nails made of gold or silver to
the goddess Shitala after the recovery of a child suffering from small
pox. Eyes and other parts of the body made of gold and silver are also
occasionally offered in fulfilment of vows. People abstain from eating
certain things till the vows are fulfilled.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e10361src" href="#xd27e10361" name="xd27e10361src">29</a></p>
<p>Vows are made in times of difficulties and sorrow. The person
afflicted with sorrow or misfortune prays to his favourite deity and
promises to offer particular things or to perform special ceremonies,
and fulfils his vows when his desired objects are attained. The
ceremonies commonly observed for these purposes are the special
<i>puj&aacute;s</i> of Satya N&aacute;r&aacute;yan and Satya
Vin&aacute;yak. Native Christians make their vows to their saints and
Mot-M&aacute;vali (Mother Mary) in the taluka of Salsette.<a class=

<p>There is a shrine of the god Shankar at Kanakeshwar a village on the
sea side two miles from <span class="corr" title=
"Source: Mitb&aacute;v">Mithb&aacute;v</span> in the Ratn&aacute;giri
District. Many years ago it so happened that a rich Mahomedan merchant
was carrying his merchandise in a ship. The ship foundered in a storm
at a distance of about two or three miles from Kanakeshwar. When the
vessel, seemed to be on the point of sinking the merchant despairing of
his life and goods, made a vow to erect a nice temple for the Hindu
shrine of Kanakeshwar if he, his vessel and its cargo were saved. By
the grace of God the vessel weathered the storm and he arrived safely
in his country with the merchandise. In fulfilment of this vow he
erected a good temple over the shrine of Shri Shankar at Kanakeshwar,
which cost him about rupees six thousand. This temple is in good
condition to the present day. Many such vows are made to special
deities. When the people get their desired objects they attribute the
success to the favour of the deity invoked, but when their expectations
are not fulfilled they blame their fate and not the deity.<a class=

<p>In the Konkan districts there are some persons who practise black
art of several kinds such as <i>Chetak</i>, <i>J&aacute;ran</i>,
<i>M&aacute;ran</i> and <i>Uch&aacute;tan</i>. <i>Chetak</i> is a kind
of evil spirit brought from the temple of the goddess Ital&aacute;i of
the Konkan districts. It is brought for a fixed or limited period, and
an annual tribute is required to be paid to the goddess for the
services.</p>
<p>Another kind of black art widely practised in the Konkan districts
is known by the name of <i>Muth m&aacute;rane</i>. In this art the
sorcerer prepares an image of wheat flour, and worships it with
flowers, incense, etc. A lemon pierced with a number of pins is then
placed before the image. The sorcerer begins to pour spoonfuls of water
mixed with <i>Jagri</i> on the face of the image, and repeats certain
<i>mantras</i>. Meanwhile, the lemon gradually disappears and goes to
the person whose death it is intended to secure. The person aimed at
receives a heavy blow in the chest and at once falls to the ground
vomitting blood. Sometimes he is known to expire instantaneously. The
charmed lemon, after completing its task returns to the sorcerer, who
anxiously awaits its return, for it is believed that if the lemon fails
to return some calamity or misfortune is sure to occur to him. For this
reason the beginner desiring to be initiated into the mystery of this
black art has to make the first trial of his <i>mantras</i> on a tree
or a fowl.</p>
<p>Females are also initiated into the mysteries of <i>J&aacute;du</i>
or black art. Such women are required to go to the burning ground at
midnight in a naked state, holding in their hands hearths containing
burning coals. While on their way they untie their hair, and then begin
the recital of their <i>mantras</i>. There they dig out the bones of
buried corpses, bring them home, and preserve them for practising black
art.</p>
<p>There is a sect of Hindus known as Sh&aacute;ktas who practise the
black art. The Sh&aacute;ktas worship their goddess at night, make
offerings of wine and flesh, and then feast thereon. <span class=

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
